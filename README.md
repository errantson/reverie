# Welcome, Dreamer

**Reverie House** is the home for all dreamers within our wild mindscape.

This repository is meant to collect, preserve, and avail its histories.

### 🏰 Home For Dreamers
Many pass through Reverie House. All are welcome to its name. Those who make residence in its place will find their fates forever tied to the home of all dreamers. As nightmares consume it, they will suffer alongside. In prosperity, they shall share the joys. This is the promise of community that it offers.

### 🧙‍♂️ Dreamweaver Directory
Dreamers wander our wild mindscape long before they stumble upon Reverie House. Only once welcomed as a dreamweaver are their journeys forever chronicled through the turning epochs, and their connection to other dreamweavers is eternally preserved. We find each other this way.

### 🔮 Your Souvenirs
As dreamers explore our wild mindscape and encounter strange dreams or perilous nightmares, they retain souvenirs of their experience. These are remembered and in time can come to define our natures in dreamweaving. Pursue experience, and be mindful of your accumulation.

### 📚 The Library
A place for fictions and facts, expanding over time with the works of various dreamweavers. The means to read here are easy, with texts remaining free and in the formats of choice. All dreamers are invited to relax and enjoy reading. Nothing strengthens our wild mindscape more than well-read minds.
