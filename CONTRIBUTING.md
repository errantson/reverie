## How to Help Reverie House

This project is unusual. It's been built by artists, dreamers, and authors still learning to code. Things were slow going for about a year, until (inevitably) some gave up their ethic and began stealing what promethean fire they could. It's been great fuel, but a terrible and painful rudder.

We prioritized creative potential and immediate experience functionality to build the scaffolding that a more technically perfect version can be modeled on. Please excuse this weaponized recklessness. Often when we tried to work with others, money or apathy stood in the way. It was impossible to explain this thing we needed, and everyone felt an urgent need to move fast before some dreams were lost forever.

All our art, writing, and creative work remains purely human. It *must* remain purely human. We want it to be! Although we feel moral in taking the machina's script in-kind for its theft of our spark, we hope for a cohesive future focused on tools that bring us together, better.

That's the point of it, essentially. Our connections, through art and interaction with one another. The providence of our shared storytelling, and the human experience of being together in our wild mindscape. To improve this, we need places like [Reverie House](https://reverie.house) and more friends who can teach us what we're already doing.

Cogitarians... Help!

## What is a Cogitarian?

By simplest definition, a person who can think via a brain.
Preferably, a good one.

We are in a strange time of inhuman tools and we need intelligent individuals to help shepherd those who spent their lives singing, painting, or otherwise dreamweaving through an era of technological demands and omnipotent temptations. You do not fear the machina, and wish to carefully guide others through those paths it offers, dangerous to the soul but powerful in destination.

### Cogitarians (Good Fits)

You'll enjoy contributing if you:
- Want to improve humanized connection through fantasy
- Believe in protecting human artistic providence  
- Value narrative potential within social graphs
- Care about ATProto and decentralized protocols
- Forgive those who can be taught through clemency
- Correct those who need principle adjustment
- Enjoy exploring bizarre edge case experiments

### Less Good Fits

- Believe in perfection over progress
- Get frustrated teaching non-technical people
- Need clean architecture before contributing
- Uncomfortable with narrative framing or pseudonyms

---

## Communication

- **GitHub Issues** - Bug reports, features, technical questions
- **Keepers Discord** - Private space, dreamweavers only
- **Reverie House** - Public space, open community

## Becoming a Cogitarian

**Cogitarians** are technical stewards who will help shape Reverie House's foundation while preserving its human focused ethos and protecting it against dehumanizations.

### Self-Appointment

Our worker system is based on **self-appointment** — you claim a role through your own authority (using ATproto), which is an exchange of trust to the community.

This adoption becomes part of our story, and will etch into the canon forever. You will stay as Cogitarian (or any other role) as long as you wish. You may even declare yourself as retiring and step down whenever someone else is ready to take over. It is meant to be self-motivated throughout.

### How It Works

**Visit** [`reverie.house/work`](https://reverie.house/work):
1. Select the "Cogitarian" role
2. Provide an app password (trust link)
3. System confirms you as our Cogitarian
4. Your name as role are announced in canon

**Once you are in the role, expect questions!**

Dreamweavers from across our wild mindscape whom visit Reverie House will see you and pester you with all manner of questions, largely through Bluesky. It's your choice what to do with them, who/what to guide them towards, or how open your messages should be.
