By way of my strangest dreams, I've found myself an occasional visitor at Reverie House. Though it's now spoken as fiction (as one must, for you to find this book) every part of me remains completely self-assured of its reality.

Countless others have come before me and told their own stories of our wild mindscape, as more will come after. This is the nature of the dreaming realms, my version of accounts being no more or less true than anyone else's. What has separated my good fortune in readership (your attention) from others who've told the same can best be described as luck in relinquishment. Surrendering to it, in some sense.

This story is not mine. It belonged to Seeker, and the others who lived it. Then later, it belonged to the history of dreamweavers and our wild mindscape. My work has only been that of liberator, recalling it from our wild mindscape and sharing it with you. In this spirit, I keep no claim over it. While I recognize that the words herein came penned by my hands, I am no more able to call myself its owner than one who claims to own the sun or the wind.

Thus, I surrender all rights of its publication to you.

*Call this story yours, for all I care\!* It may as well be.

By this giving of my labors (the hours spent awake in writing, and those asleep in dreams) I empower you to take share in everything it could ever bring me. If there is fame or wealth to be found within the words ahead, then let them be yours. No longer am in need of such things. More, I hope you find the truth within it, and your own way to a place between dreams. Perhaps it is there where we will meet.

Though, let us make room for the story. Our story. Your story\! Ahead in pages comes the tale of Seeker, who by all accounts is a rather minor figure in the long history of Reverie House. Though, his place and *(more importantly)* his time carried particular significance over the course of an era marked by tumult, invention, and change. His witness to this period better served my own understanding of what it means to be a dreamweaver, than any acts of heroism or genius.

It was through researching Seeker's arrival and their conquering of The Unending Nightmare that my memories *(which are quite weak between dreams)* of Reverie House began to hold. Soon after, the natures of our wild mindscape felt obvious and it became easier to understand those rare and wonderful dreamers who master the art of dreamweaving. Thus it is Seeker's Reverie that we tell of first, for without it we cannot fathom the rest.

Thank you for your generosity.

*Thank you for your dreams\!*

*For every child still in Omelas.*
