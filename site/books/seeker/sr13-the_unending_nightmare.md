For the first time since The Unending Nightmare consumed them, the last chance heroes of Reverie House are at ease. The battle to enter Callie's nightmare has been costly and exhausting. Content and grateful, they nestle on the shell of a flying dream-turtle, coasting towards golden light.

The monad persists. Poor Pierre was right all along. Down in the depths of Callie's nightmare, more dreamers and Joy resist the oppression of the darkness as one. They are unified in a single homogenized vision of hope. They have given themselves to it, surrendering their will to benevolent self-dissolution. Seeker is optimistic at the discovery, its apparition has given him a long-needed course.

Everyone but Bakun is in awe. The wild-head remains insistent they revert course. "This isn't what Michael and the others wanted," provides a weak case for his pursuing oblivion at its strongest point. His pleas grow more radical, he is a rush of entropy fighting the vacuum's force. 

"They wanted us to find a way," argues Del on behalf of the fallen. "Maybe this is it. Maybe the monad works?"

"I'm not going in." Petunia is blunt. "If it's what they say it is, then it's total exposure. I have secrets to keep, and none that any of you want to know. It is better that I stay my own separate entity." She'd rather die than conform.

Bakun readily agrees, "It's a bad trip, and it lasts forever." Death doesn't seem so bad, if death is change. "You give yourself to that thing, and it's got you forever\! It will change you. Even if we do survive, you won't be the same.

It's a deal the little witch won't take. "Never\!" she lets go of Tawny. Petunia wants to face the nightmare herself. Not to beat it (she cannot do that), but to understand its way. Never would she open herself to another person the way she feels prepared to surrender to this void. People never offered so much in return.

"Where are you going?" her best friend asks.

"All we lose is time, and all we suffer is pain." She is going where all the others have gone. Through the abyss, into suffering. There, she will learn. Without anyone else's permission, Petunia flings herself into darkness. She lets the void consume her soul. The Unending Nightmare teaches the little witch long spells of suffering. She keeps souvenirs of her friends, family, and home.

"She's right to go," says her best friend, "It will take us all eventually. Why wait?" Tawny disassociates as depression in the void takes away all her will to fight. "We were so wrong. Nobody can dream *this* away." The tigress doubts the monad will survive. "I don't want to go. There's still so much we haven't seen." She clings to Delroy who is barely alert. The oppressive nightmare drains out their spirits, makes them accept a cold eternal slumber. "Can't we just stay here forever?" she asks in a yawn. They've carved a fine place in oblivion and none want to lose what little they have.

Delroy can live in a nightmare if it's with Taw but, "Here on the turtle? No, I don't think so." It doesn't seem feasible. They're getting too caught up in other people's dreams again. He starts to regret being picky about their own. "It would make a bad finoir," the critic jests. They swim in dying memories of what they once had.

"I agree," his love replies, "A terrible end."

They try to conjure what they remember, but it's muted, broken, and vague. Their finoir is not defined enough to survive The Unending Nightmare, but the heart within it does. They are laying on the shell, looking at one another, and in their dream it echoes in manifold. Through all times, places, and beings, they are connected for eternity. Only the world around them changes. It is nothing to them now.

"When we fall apart again, will you find me?" Tawny feels herself coming undone in the abyss. She knows they won't survive this trip to the monad. They are both still too imperfect, and must continue to change. Void will claim them again, and away they'll fly on suffering until love's gravity reunites for their encore. "I will find you."

Seeker imagines recovering a splintered person, as the two lovers told him was possible. Seeing the memories pour out of another, helping someone else recompose. Tawny and Delroy *know* one another because of this. It reconnects them across epochs of time in dreams. The purpose they find in each other calls them back from nightmares and reverie. It pulls them back to our wild mindscape, to dreamweaving in search of one another. Love persists through dreaming and death, so they transcend both. The boy does not know anyone like they know each other. He has never tried to before. There wasn't anything in him to know.

 As Bakun begs for recourse, Del and Taw fade away. Their lover's embrace disconnects in the night. Comfortably toward demise they split, certain they'll come together near dawn. They care only for each other. Neither spare concern for golden light. Seeker bids them farewell.

"This is serious\!" Bakun warns Seeker's course. Just the two of them now, the wild-head begs for the party to keep going. "The monad's not a thing. The monad is flat. It's a mute, it's a null. Let's go back to infinity\!" They both still know the way, "We can turn it all around on itself. We can do *anything* else. We can find *any* other way."

Seeker can't heed his word, it comes too desperate and dire. "What are you afraid of?" he must inquire.

"Ruining their dream." Bakun sees himself a poison, "I can't do any good. Neither can you. Nobody can."

"Why can't I?" asks the boy. "Why can't I do good?" He stands in a light of others, defying darkness.

"It's not possible," asserts the obstinate wild-head. Seeker knows he could never be helped. "Nightmares are problems we solve on our own." Bakun is still trapped in his. "It's not worth the intent or the effort to try."

"I wish to do good, whether possible or not." Seeker does not see the harm in wasted efforts, or pointless intent. "Is that not reason enough?"

"No, it isn't." Bakun asserts he's done more harm than good. "What we do and affect is not ours to decide." Seeker hears the wild-head spun several seasons wiser since their introduction. His reasons need to be more assured.

"I think I can help." The boy wants to, more than he believes that he can. "With others,  we can help. We can try\!" He drags them down into it. "Together, we can survive."

Bakun cannot shake the dreamweaver to sense. "There's no surviving this\! Forget that delusion right now. You're not escaping the nightmare. Nobody can\!" He stands in contradiction of the golden light's evidence, as if it was not the proof Seeker saw. "We can't ever save one another," the wild-head offers infinity once more, "but we can have a good time, regardless\!"

Seeker escaped his nightmare on his own, as he escaped the labyrinth, and all other dreams. It is by our choice that we become enthralled by visions, and our own choice that brings us out. "I can still choose what I want?"

Bakun agrees, they are. "Aye. Of course\!"

"Well, you're right. Nobody helped end my suffering, or yours, but I know someone tried." Seeker denies Bakun's invitation and invites a course of his own. "This light is proof that we are the goodness we give one another is seen, felt." Seeker is blinded by its glow, which is still so dim to Bakun. "Whether she knows what it is or not, this light still stands as proof she is not alone. It's the help we can provide."

"There is such thing as help\!" Bakun stays deep in the nightmare. He grows tired of the newcomer's piety. Oblivion steals bits of their essence as they argue. "Go ahead, then\! Become one with a monad. Seek enlightenment in others and find nothing on the way. Or, just accept that we're already as wretched as can be and just enjoy the freedom of dreaming\!" Bakun offers Seeker death and life, everything all at once. "Death is nothing. Nightmares are nothing. We will find our way back to dreaming, then nightmare, then dream\! It goes on forever, and you can never run out\! Why give up all that? There are so many things you still haven't dreamt."

Seeker still wants, "I am tired of dreams."

So does Bakun, "Dreams are all we have."

A great golden orb hovers ahead in the darkness. It is as grand as half of the boy's view and casts a radiance upon them. Seeker can sense Joy within.

The turtle offers dismount. It cannot cross a threshold of stronger beliefs. Bakun burns in the light, and begs Seeker amid final scorch. "Don't do it\!" The wild-head doesn't chase, "Trust me\! I know."

"What is it?" Seeker follows instinct, not knowledge.

"A choice," Bakun offers reticent. "One we are not ready to take." Seeker knows none can prepare for this step. "Come on, let's go see." Bakun offers a hand, "Nightmares really aren't that bad\!" The man of infinity cannot accept the stasis of peace and runs to every corner looking for exits.

"A choice?" Seeker echoes, unsure of what he's asking. He reasons it for himself, but cannot come to understanding. "To end suffering? To end happiness?" He knows something of himself will be lost in the process, but it offers no answers. The monad is only a resonance in the void.

"To end yourself\!" Bakun's plea is true-hearted. Only here does he fear losing a friend. "To end your dreams and make them for everyone else instead. To take all theirs on."

*To become one with everyone else.*

They reach a line Bakun cannot cross. The monad can only receive those with an open heart. Seeker faces hope in a nightmare, and accepts dissolving. Seeker does not fear unity, he desires it. Bakun is pulled into an old darkness, as the lost dreamer steps forward into the light.

*What do you offer?*

They are both asked from a place between dreams.

*Purpose? Love? Faith?*

Nothing that Seeker gives can solve pain.

Bakun offers nothing at all.

The monad shines on them both and they reach the end of their journey together. The wild-head takes the turtle when he goes, and they race away through the dark storm. Seeker keeps both their dreams alive. Two lost dreamers split ways between choice and truth, never again to reunite as the selves that first met.

The boy, a dreamweaver and seeker of things, is asked to give up all that he is and could ever become. In the depths of this darkest nightmare, the choice remains his alone. 

*What can I hope to offer?*

There is goodness in people, he is certain.

*What am I able to offer?*

Goodness eternal in himself, he can't see.

*What may I need to offer?*

Purpose takes as he gives it to others.

*What do I want to offer?*

He cannot set anyone free.

Dreams and friends are gone by. He wishes them well and says farewell with regret. It is too late to turn back now. Beneath the monad—bound souls of many, the dreamweaver finds himself truly, absolutely, utterly, alone.

*I have only myself to offer.*

*I have only myself to take.*

One must give something of themselves in their life. Without doing so, you do not have life—you have growth. The choice of this gift is ours to bring to the world and only this way may a dreamweaver find their perfect dream.

By his choice alone, Seeker surrenders to unification.

*I give myself. I give you life.*

The monad takes a dreamer.

Joy overwhelms him completely.
