For the first time since The Unending Nightmare consumed them, the last chance heroes of Reverie House are resting at ease. The battle to enter Callie's nightmare has been costly and exhausting. Content and grateful, they nestle on the shell of a flying dream-turtle, coasting towards golden light.

The monad persists\! Poor Pierre was right all along. Down in the depths of Callie's nightmare, more dreamers and Joy resist oppression as one. They are unified in a single homogenized vision of hope. They have given themselves to it, surrendering their will to benevolent self-dissolution. Seeker is optimistic at the discovery. All others but Bakun are just curious.

The wild-head remains insistent they revert course. "This isn't what Michael and the others wanted," provides a weak case for his pursuing oblivion at its strongest point. His pleas grow more radical, a rush of entropy fighting the vacuum's force to revert. 

"They wanted us to find a way," argues Del on behalf of the fallen. "Maybe this is it. Maybe the monad works?"

"I'm not going in." Petunia is blunt. "If it is what they say it is, then it's total exposure. I have secrets to keep, and none that any of you want to know. It is better that I stay my own separate entity." She'd rather die than conform.

Bakun readily agrees, "It's a bad trip, and its lasts forever." Death doesn't seem so bad, if death is change. "You give yourself to that thing, and it's got you for life\! It will change you. Even if we do survive, you won't be the same.

It's a deal the witch won't take. "Never\!" The little witch lets go of Tawny. She wants to face the nightmare herself. Not to beat it (she cannot do that), but to understand its way.

"Where are you going?" her best friend asks.

"All we lose is time, and all we suffer is pain." She is going where all the others have gone. Through the abyss, into suffering. There, she will learn. Without anyone else's permission, Petunia flings herself into darkness. She lets the void consume her soul. The Unending Nightmare teaches the little witch long spells of suffering. She keeps souvenirs of friends, family, and home.

"She's right to go," says her best friend, "It'll take us all eventually. Why wait?" Tawny disassociates as depression  in the void takes away her will to fight. "We were all wrong. Nobody can dream *this* away." The tigress doubts the monad will survive. "I don't want to go. There's still so much we haven't seen." She clings to Delroy who is barely alert. The oppressive nightmare drains out their spirits, makes them accept a cold eternal slumber. "Can't we just stay here forever?" she asks in a yawn. They've carved a fine place in oblivion. None want to lose what little they have.

Delroy can live in a nightmare if it's with her but, "Here on the turtle? No, I don't think so." It doesn't seem feasible. They are too caught up in other people's dreams. He starts to regret being picky about theirs. "It would make a bad finoir," the critic jests. They swim in dying memories of what they once had.

"I agree," his love replies, "A terrible end."

They try to conjure what they remember, but it's muted, broken, and vague. Their finoir is not defined enough to survive The Unending Nightmare, but the heart within it does. They are laying on the shell, looking at one another, and in their dream it echoes in manifold. Through all times, places, and beings, they are connected for eternity. Only the world around them changes. It is nothing to them now.

"When we fall apart again, will you find me?" Tawny feels herself coming undone in the abyss. She knows they won't survive this trip to the monad. They are both still imperfect, and must continue to change. Void will claim them again, and away they'll fly on suffering until love's gravity reunites their encore. "I will find you."

Seeker imagines recovering a splintered person, as the two lovers told him was possible. Seeing the memories pour out of another, helping someone else recompose. Tawny and Delroy *know* one another because of this. It reconnects them across epochs of time in dreams. The purpose they find in each other calls them back from nightmares and reverie. It pulls them back to our wild mindscape, to dreamweaving in search of one another. Love persists in through dreaming and death, so they transcend both. The boy does not know anyone like they know each other. He has never tried to before. There wasn't anything in him to know.

 As Bakun begs for recourse, Del and Taw fade away. Their lover's embrace disconnects in the night. Comfortably toward demise they split, certain they'll come together near dawn. They care only for each other. Neither spare concern for golden lights. Seeker bids them farewell.

"This is serious\!" Bakun warns Seeker's course. Just the two of them now, the wild-head begs the party to keep going. "The monad's not a thing. The monad is flat. It's a mute, it's a null. Let's go back to infinity\!" They both still know the way, "We can turn it all around on itself. We can do *anything* else. We can find *any* other way."

Seeker can't heed his word, it comes too desperate and dire. "What are you afraid of?" he must inquire.

"Ruining their dream," Bakun sees himself a poison. "I can't do any good. Neither can you. Nobody can."

"Why can't I?" asks the boy. "Why can't I do good?" He stands in a light of others, defying darkness.

"It's not possible," asserts the obstinate wild-head. Seeker knows he could never be helped. "Nightmares are problems we solve on our own." Bakun is still trapped in his. "It's not worth the intent or the effort to try."

"I wish to do good, whether possible or not." Seeker does not see the harm in wasted efforts, or pointless intent. "Is that not reason enough?"

"No, it isn't." Bakun asserts. He's done more harm than good. "What we do and affect is not ours to decide." Seeker hears a wild-head spun several seasons wiser. "His reasons need to be more assured.

"I think I can help." The boy wants to, more than he believes that he can. "With others,  we can help. We can try." He drags them down into it. "Together, we can survive."

Bakun cannot shake the dreamweaver to sense. "There's no surviving this\! Forget that delusion right now. You're not escaping the nightmare. Nobody can\!" He stands in contradiction of the evident golden light, as if it was not the proof Seeker saw. "We cannot save one another. Only have a good time," a wild-head offers infinity once more.

Dreamweaver Seeker escaped his nightmare on his own, as he escaped the labyrinth, and all future dreams. It is by our choice that we become enthralled by visions, and our own choice that brings us out. "I am master of my own will."

Bakun agrees, they are. "Aye."

"My sufferings are self-relieved. As yours and all others are." Seeker no longer defends against Bakun's invitation, he invites a course of his own. "This light is proof we are seen, by the goodness we give one another." Seeker is blinded by its glow, which his friend can barely see. "Whether she can see it or not. Whether or not she knows what it is. This light makes you wonder, and know you are not alone. It is a help we can provide."

"There is such thing as help." Bakun stays in nightmare. He grows tired of the newcomer's piety. Oblivion steals bits of their essence as they argue. "Go ahead, then. Become one with a monad. Seek enlightenment in others and find nothing on the way. Or, just accept that we're already as wretched as we can be and enjoy our lifetimes of dreaming obscene\!" Bakun offers Seeker death and life, all in one. "Death is nothing. Nightmares are nothing. We will find our way back to dreaming, then nightmare, then dream\! Why give up all that? There are so many things you still haven't dreamt."

Seeker wants one thing, "I am tired of dreams."

"Dreams are all we have."

A great golden orb hovers ahead in the darkness. It is as grand as half of his view and casts a radiance upon them. Seeker can sense Joy within.

The turtle offers dismount. It cannot cross a threshold of stronger beliefs. Bakun burns in the light, and begs Seeker in final scorch. "Don't do it\!" The wild-head doesn't chase, "Trust me. I know."

"What is it?" Seeker follows instinct, not knowledge.

"A choice," Bakun offers reticent. "One we are not ready to take." Seeker knows none can prepare for this step. "Come on, let's go see." Bakun offers a hand, "Nightmares really aren't that bad\!" The man of infinity cannot accept the stasis of peace.

"A choice?" Seeker echoes, unsure of what he asks. He reasons himself, what the dreamer does not understand. "To end suffering? To end happiness?" The monad is only a resonance in the void.

"To end yourself\!" Bakun's plea is true hearted. Only here does he fear losing a friend. "To end your dreams and make them for everyone else instead. To take *them* on."

*To become one with everyone else.*

Seeker does not fear unity, he desires it. Bakun pulls into a darkness, as the lost dreamer steps into the light.

They reach a line Bakun cannot cross. The monad can only receive those with an open heart. Seeker faces hope in a nightmare, and accepts dissolving.

*What do you offer?*

They are both asked from a place between dreams.

*Purpose? Love? Faith?*

Nothing that Seeker gives can solve pain.

Bakun offers nothing at all.

The monad shines on them both. Bakun is guarded, Seeker free. They reach the end of their journey together. The wild-head will take the turtle when he goes, make it his. Seeker keeps both their dreams alive. The lost dreamers split ways between a choice and the truth, never again to meet.

"Goodbye, you fool."

The boy, the dreamweaver, the Seeker of things, is asked to give up all that he is. In this place at the depths of the darkest of nightmares, the choice left to him is at hand.

*What do I hope to offer?*

There is goodness in people, he is certain.

*What do I hope to offer?*

Goodness eternal in himself, he can't see.

*What do I hope to offer?*

Purpose takes as he gives it to others.

*What do I hope to offer?*

He cannot set anyone free.

Dreams and friends are gone by. He wishes them well and says so long with regret. It is too late to turn back now. Beneath the monad—a true soul of many, the dreamweaver finds himself truly, absolutely, alone.

*I have only myself to offer.*

*I have only myself to take.*

One must give something of themselves in their life. Without doing so, you do not have life—you have growth. The choice of this gift is ours to bring to the world and every dreamweaver finds their perfect dream.

By his choice alone, Seeker surrenders to unification.

*I give myself. I give you life.*

The monad takes the dreamer.

Joy overwhelms him completely.
