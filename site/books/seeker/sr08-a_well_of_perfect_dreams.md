Seeker darts through the foyer's busy crowd more aggressively than he means to. He must reach Joy before she vanishes again. Hurried feet knock over a thick walking staff resting near his takeoff. A gruff woodsman scowls. Seeker doesn't look back—his long-sought friend is already beyond view. He weaves through the mess of people. Bumping shoulders with a sweating seamstress who is adjusting her friend's breastplate. The hasty boy earns double-doses of ire.

It is a strange feeling, coming from the cellar where he had so much control, to his present clumsy state. There is a great disconnect from the self who was able to perform incredible feats with unwavering accuracy in dreams, and his *real* body which moves with less intention. This body has a general sense of where it needs to go, but no design to its movement. There is no craft to his action. Reality in our wild mindscape is firmer than his dreaming and he is still trying to move the world around him, rather than himself.

Finally clear of the foyer's chaos, Seeker bounds up the stairs with limber legs. He calls after her, "Joy\! Wait\!" When he reaches the top of the flight, she's nowhere to be found. The boy is gutted in disappointment. She was *just* there\! How could he have missed her?\! It isn't fair.

At the top of the stairs there is a narrow hallway with a dozen numbered doors. A few dreamweavers linger in the passage, but Joy is not among them. The boy moves between sets of people, checking faces for familiarity and finds none. Though, two recognize him. "Oh, I know you\! Sneaker, is it?" a moon-faced loverboy invokes him a new identity.

"No, no." A tigress corrects, "It was Speaker."

The lost boy cannot place either of them, but hopes they can help. "It's Seeker," he fixes once feeling how wrong their misheard versions sound. "Did Joy come this way?"

"Who is that?"

"She's…" Seeker cannot explain Joy. "I saw her just a second ago. Did someone come up the stairs before me?"

"Hmm," the loverboy hadn't noticed, "I don't know. Did you see anyone, Taw?"

"Maybe?" She shrugs. "Not sure?" Taw is unhelpful,  but kind. "How have you been anyway?" The tigress speaks as if they are old mates, "Del bet you'd never make it back."

"Excuse me?" Seeker is affronted by these strangers betting his fate. Who in hell are Del and Taw? "Have we met before?" They bear no resemblance whatsoever.

"I'm *Tawny*, this is *Delroy*." She is offended. "We met on your first day." He remembers now, so vaguely. They were next to the man with the chicken—Ollie\! Seeker's hazy memory of the event gains greater clarity as his present better informs the contents of his past. He now remembers Tawny and Delroy in fuller definition, as the scene of his welcoming party expands. They came with Ollie. Michael was there too. Though, the boy felt a distant shoulder from the knight as they passed in the foyer. It seemed as if he recalled their meeting with even less fullness than Seeker.

"Ah\!" He laughs. "My memory is funny." How unlike his first impressions they now seem. What has their impression of him been? Based on the bet, he could guess. "Del 'n Taw." Nobody has ever said it like that before to them. It earns a double-look. "Sorry."

"It's okay. We got your name wrong." Delroy shrugs. "You're looking for…" A bit gumpy, he asks, "Joy?"

"She's a girl," says Seeker of his friend, "near this tall." He does not like explaining her. "Braided hair, green frock." He wonders what she said of him, before their introduction. "She's very kind. She had a grey shawl. She's got a cough?" The boy regrets saying the last bit. Seeker wonders how he himself will be described by Del & Taw when he's not there. "She's *very* kind. She introduced me when I first arrived."

"Oh. Her?" Delroy questions Seeker's taste.

"That's her name?" Tawny assumes the same as Del. "We don't know her very well." The tigress scratches bitchy, "We're not friends."

"Oh." Seeker questions his alliances.

"She thinks we're too inexperienced for a finoir\!" Tawny lays out all of their dirty laundry. "Just because she's been here forever doesn't make her an expert on our lives," Taw gets right. "It doesn't make her an expert on anything," Taw gets wrong.

"Babe. We don't need to bother him with—"

"No, I gotta get this out Dellie." Seeker is caught in the crossfire of something he does not understand.

"Taw. Babe. It's no big deal. She just said—"

"She said that we haven't seen anything and we're giving up too quickly. She said you're lazy, and I'm vain," Tawny paraphrases inexactly.

"You are overexaggerating. She just said—"

"I heard what she said. I know what she meant."

"Babe, it was just advice."

"And you think it was helpful?"

"I don't know. Maybe?"

Seeker is quickly losing his window of opportunity. "Sorry. I *need* to find her." It seems overstated in retrospect.

There are no locks in Reverie House. Privacy should never be expected. This does not stop horrible things from taking place behind closed doors. The boy witnesses one.

Without pausing to knock, he bursts open Door \#6 on a little witch making nightmares. Seeker sorely regrets it. She defends her dorm with a vision of rattlesnakes. They warn before biting, to better mock her trespassers with poison. Whatever other dreams she wields, the grotesqueries of his swelling leg and oozing pustules are enough to cause flee.

The little witch thinks about moving out.

"Wow, a natural\!" Tawny and Delroy are impressed by Seeker's swift exit. It seemed the work of an escape artist. They are back in a lover's embrace. They've moved on from their petty argument about finoir. "You got out quick\!"

"Petunia let him off easy. Rattlesnakes are nothing." Tawny knows the true horrors her best friend can deliver.

Delroy adjusts his posture to talk shop. It breaks their sweet embrace. "It's still pretty impressive for a newcomer." The witch's curses had previously bound Delroy for millenia. Tawny was responsible for his escape. "How'd you do it?" Seeker broke free instantaneously. "Beginners luck?"

"Maybe I was more scared?" The boy feels ignorant and unable to explain his ease of sortie. Fear moves him, but his inability to regard reality in any serious way makes the sticky nightmare slide off Seeker's back. All those who conquer Bakun's labyrinth gain this power. Reverie House is now a beacon through infinity and he can go home anytime.

Seeker tries more doors. Joy couldn't have vanished. He marches a few more steps, nervously shouts "Joy??\!" and then gets a "No. Go away," from a quiet group resting behind Door \#5. Seeker doesn't know if she's passed through, away, or on a dream. She could be anywhere in our wild mindscape. He surrenders his pursuit. If they meet again, he'll make the most of it.

"We're going to the well," Delroy offers. "She might have gone that way." Seeker remembers the courtyard.

"She's a hypocrite\!" Tawny lights the match.

"Maybe." Delroy fans the flame with an exhale.

Tawny leads their course down the spireway, "She's made a dozen finoirs." Delroy doesn't mention that it's only a *finoir* once it's final. "Then she has the nerve to tell us not to look forward to anything\!" Delroy doesn't mention that it isn't easy looking forward to forever. "It's hypocritical to live one way and tell someone else not to—that's literally what hypocrite means." Delroy doesn't mention that it's not.

Joy is found nowhere along the way.

The courtyard is open and dreamweavers play. Seeker follows Taw y Del to the fountain at its center. Along the way he sees dreams of loved ones, of experience, and style.

"What should we look for?" Delroy asks Seeker.

"I don't know what else to look for," he answers.

"I want to visit Decrees." Tawny has a mission.

"Decrees? Peepaw is top-ten crazy." Delroy spews finoir facts before questioning, "Why Decrees?" He knows Tawny doesn't like Peepaw and can think of a dozen better worlds to show a newcomer, but Tawny isn't thinking of Seeker at all.

"I want to make sure I remember something right." Tawny has a bone to pick with her witchy best friend. Recently they have debated about finoirs and heredity, and Petunia used something from The Decrees of Peepaw as an example but, "This isn't *about* Peepaw," the tigress insists.

"Peepaw is fantastic." Delroy reiterates. "If we can make a *great* finoir like Decrees, then maybe we're ready." The loverboy breaks Tawny's heart. "I mean—his finoir is *so* detailed—Ours is…" *Shit.* The girl won't say so, but agrees. "It's getting better," She is glad to hear him addend hope to their future.

The finoir they started constructing after first falling in love remains meager at best. So far, the only thing they sorted is that it's them on a bed, just looking at one another. Sometimes it's in great fortune, and sometimes it's in great sickness. Yet, they can't agree if the sky should be night or day, and all of their designs are unrefined. Still, they both know that their eternal dream is of love.

"It's getting better." She is sure of that.

Seeker looks down the well and sees a deep pool of phanera. "These are *finoir*?" They confirm. Heaped in a reservoir below, this is where they put the dreams that never end. Ceaseless worlds, each uniquely tuned to their keepers. Seeker is reminded of the nightmare that he first came from, and of the waking world—these realities would last forever. Each finoir, a person lost to eternity.

Dreams like these are self-elected. Dreamweavers and idle dreamers alike stay fixed forever in their *finoir* once they discover or build a dream they deem perfect to their desire.

There is a pull-bucket on a chain to draw them up. Seeker reviews some from the tub and finds little bubbles of people stopped in picturesque realities. Most of them are living in some ideal world that the boy can easily understand. He sifts through and examines as if he were picking produce. These dreams are dense in their commitment, though small because they're too personal. He cannot influence them.

"Oh, ignore those." Tawny advises. "They don't *mean* anything." Neither Taw nor Del find them worthwhile at all. Like most dreamweavers, they are uninterested in the private endings of others—such dreams are too obscure in their symbols and too specific in their emotions for casual visitors. Finoir make for tepid dream exploration, as one cannot affect the finished dreams of others. One cannot play. Tawny dismisses them entirely—she wants to visit dreams that *say* something. The small phanera Seeker finds in the bucket are the most inexpressive finoirs, locked in subjective specificity. They can matter only to their keeper, so go unregarded and shrink. "The weightier ones are at the bottom."

Seeker doesn't disdain them as much as the veterans. Perhaps in time he will. He sees some finoir here that he can identify with. Most of the people are quite happy, or having a classic good time. These forevers don't seem so bad to him. He'd thought his unending nightmare was forever—though he couldn't recall how it started. He could only remember its wretched pains and that he'd managed to escape. "Are they trapped?" he asks, unsure if such joyful forevers are good or bad.

"Yes." Delroy is honest. "They'll never get out."

"They chose that freely. They don't think it's a cage," Taw lays the harsh truth, "even though *theirs* definitely are." 

Delroy agrees. He is a serious finoir critic and often equates memorabilia with worth. Personal dreams are the least interesting of all because they are the least shareable. They belong so wholly to those who keep them that nobody else can gain very much. This is why he and Tawny explore the well depths and the yonders of our wild mindscape. Out there, they met interesting people having interesting dreams they could take part in. Finoir took a more objective and less participatory spirit to enjoy, which Delroy had in spades. 

"Finoir Review stopped doing the pull-bucket personals by  its third edition." Dreamweaver Delroy—the finoir critic—used to write a pulpit giving directions to good finoir. It was quite popular among newcomers to Reverie House and survived double-digit editions, until the library's press broke. Delroy tried to fix it, but gave up after having a row with librarian Zowell. Tawny and Delroy still explore dreams and visit the unique dimensions of finoir as if the paper still ran, but more lately it has been ad hoc and less purposed. They now desperately crave dreams more substantive than the pedestrian fare Seeker finds in the pull-bucket. "The *good stuff* is below."

"Deep is where they get weird." Finoir Review proved this thesis with its guide to some truly fascinating places. "Decrees is insane and you're going to love it\!" Del's review had been a little naive in its exuberance, but he maintains his approval well past its prime. "Though, be careful not to find Decrees Two. Someone *else* made that, and it's a different kind of crazy." The critic is happiest when he's illuminating someone else's worldview (with his ideals).

Delroy believes that it's our wildest dreams which people remember the most, and his explorations of the well prove that it's the craziest notions that drive the most rich and fascinating lives. *What else can there be?* This question drives them (along with many other dreamweavers) to explore the yonders of our wild mindscape. What that says about *us* is the question the flaneur more deeply pursues.

"Dump the bucket," Tawny takes it away from Seeker. She tosses the lightweight dreams to the depths, and hooks her foot on the handle. She climbs down the chain hand over hand and plants foot in the pull-bucket when it reaches the end of the chain's slack. Perched on her hanging sparrow's nest, she surveys the depths of the well. From this position she can see thousands of finoir, and over the crest of the immediate crater where their work of dream excavation has made its greatest mark.

"Check this out," ushers Delroy as they follow down the pull-chain. It gives to their weight slightly. It's lost some integrity through the increasing abuse, ever since Delroy mentioned this method of descent in Finoir Review's seventh edition. The well's designer (Karla) had not expected a rash of hobbyist dream spelunkers to use it as a rope-ladder. It was meant for the recently bereaved to revisit their friends lost to finoir. This was now much harder thanks to Del.

The descent is tricky with three on the chain, but Seeker holds on with an adventurer's strength. He is dazzled by the shimmering, glowing store of phanera that crest in static waves beneath him. There are so many, some no bigger than a pebble, yet the pool is more vast than he can see in the darkness of the enclosed phanera-light. Their shadows cover what little light comes from above. Finoir are beautiful, but they are not vibrant like living dreams. The worlds are all too small and too many to make sense of, so Seeker returns to his tour guide.

"You can get lost in here for ages," Delroy warns. "The only way out is through a dream of your own."

The new boy doesn't mention that he's never made a dream before. He has only played in the dreams of others.

"Peepaw used to come here a lot." Delroy informs, "He basically lived in Reverie House, but before our time. Would have loved to have met him. Though, I guess his finoir does that well enough… You'll see. He was totally nuts."

Seeker remembers the wild-headed man. "Do you know Bakun?" he asks. He may never find Joy again, but he must track down the wild-headed bastard for abandoning him in the labyrinth. Tawny and Del laugh. They know him very well. They've both been through his labyrinth, and left the cellar when they felt ready to get on with life. On their own, not too long after, they each started working on finoir.

"Peepaw's *way* crazier than Bakun." Tawny assures, as a matter of both confirmation and taste. She's seen enough dreams to know the difference between crazies. "It's just what happens to people who STAY HERE TOO LONG." She prods up the chain to Delroy, who is still beguiling Seeker with the finer points of gifted dreamweaving.

"It's true. Decrees could not exist without Peepaw's extended stay at Reverie House." Delroy's critique in Finoir Review took a metatextual reading of what's found within: 

Few finoir are so overtly made as messages to us. Decrees is thus a generous gift, quite literally giving proof to our shared experience. It remains a worthy and fascinating visit on multiple returns for those who contemplate the very nature of our wild mindscape.

— Dreamweaver Delroy

"It's proof that our experiences here are as real as any in the waking world." Delroy reiterates his thesis, edited.

Tawny spots it from her chain-perch, "Over there." She points to a hefty globule peeking through the cracks between other dreams. "It's not far today."

Delroy the tour guide works for tips. "Alright. Ready? We're going to dive right through the guff and I'll lead you straight to where we wanna go." Tour guides are hypnotists. "Just ignore everything except for the sound of my voice." He says the next bit strange, "Follow my *beautiful* voice." 

Tawny rolls her eyes but she knows his method works. The tigress leaves ahead of them, taking a swan dive through the well of dreams. She clears the way to Decrees.

Delroy tells Seeker to drop, then jumps in after him. Down the well of perfect dreams, they free-fall. Seeker lands in a finoir made for someone normal and self-satisfied—she is happy on her yacht with her best friend, the fortune teller. 

Seeker follows quickly once he hears Delroy's voice. The voice comes from a deeper place than the dreaming and pulls the lost wanderer through countless other finoir.

*Follow my beautiful voice.*

Delroy keeps his guide through their descent. They are denser than the light dreams that surface easily. Seeker sinks  through worlds of abundance, and comfort, and satisfaction. He shuts his eyes before he's overtaken by encompassing realms of persons, and lovers, and families. Seeker holds focus on the *beautiful* voice and its odd phrasing until they arrive at The Decrees of Peepaw.

The new dreamweaver finds a bizarre world that he does not understand. There are *words*… Literal words, and phrases. Everywhere\! Words are everywhere, and everything. They are scrawled on every blade of grass and every part of the sky. There are nothing but words, words, words. 

DECREE \#1 is etched on the sun: **Dreamin's free\!**

Peepaw opens with what matters. Delroy finds it profound. Tawny likes that one too. Seeker is very glad he read the first one first. "Dreamin's free\!" they concur.

DECREE \#2 is etched on a cloud that drifted quite far before Peepaw finished the other 214,798 decrees and sealed the finoir at ends. Seeker can't see it. Delroy knows it says, "Everybody gets to dream whatever they want and nobody can stop them, but I'm giving you these dreams to keep."

DECREE \#3 is etched on the sky itself: *"I bequeath the following dreams to these forementioned characters known to be habiting at Reverie House in this, my final act and dream within our wild mindscape. Please abide both these solemn declarations and the advices hereto within. They are my life's work and final offering as I bring to you this finoir as proofs evident to my sincerity in these gifts and these commands or advices hereto within called decrees. Attend all warnings and suggestions of these decrees with the utmost severity and respect as I will forever be unable to provide further assistance upon the absolute conclusion of these finoir decrees…* (It continues for several miles)

DECREE \#4 is etched in a broken stick and rambles on about someone named Roxy and how she gets nothing, "Never to be forgiven for her crimes against good dreams\!"

Peepaw's shorthand improved while writing the rest.

DECREE \#212 is on a blade of grass, nearly in code: "Bik o d'nanerlan."

Delroy's articles assured that the phrases were fully decipherable (though not fully to him). It is assumed that the shorthand was more easily understood by the people it was meant for. A majority of their meaning has been completely lost to time. Seeker is fascinated and sifts, reading through more leaves of grass. 

Overall, the decrees are nonsense. They make odd demands that cannot be enforced and offer strange things that nobody can give or take. Seeker is vortexed in the self-contradiction and self-importance of the proclamations. There are parts that delve into fantastical lunacy, and recite poetry of incomprehensible meaning. Many of its points are completely self-defeated. Peepaw, as the latter dreamweavers called him, did not keep continuity or temperament.

DECREE \#10,110 is etched on a pinecone: "Nobody's allowed to use my dream about winged monkeys ever again\!" It dares one to try.

The decrees are everywhere. Everything in this man's world is etched with some demand, statement, or meaning. Seeker reads the decrees at random and realizes the madness that prolonged dreaming can bring. "What is this?" The boy cannot make sense of it. "Someone… dreamt this? Why?"

"Someone *is* this." Delroy knows that Peepaw is still here. He knows that finoir is a state of being.

"What?"

"It's like a last will and testament. We don't actually know his name, but he definitely wanted us to read this."

DECREE \#18,411 is etched on a root: "Ye hav to give this'n all t'dreams a-way. This'nt must'f all."

Delroy removes some of the mythology. "There are lots of finoir like this, people making final proclamations. This one's only interesting because it's so blatantly overt." His critique has matured since experiencing more of the well, "Peepaw is a wonder to see, but he was some guy that wanted to retire into a finoir that *said* something. Which I suppose he did, *quite literally*." Seeker understands the critic's role in defining their concept of art. Many people who visit Decrees without Delroy's guidance think nothing of it. "It was just floating on the surface when I found it, nobody knew what it was."

"You found it?"

"Yes." Del's got pride. "Well, no. There were others before me, obviously. I've got to assume that at least some of the people mentioned in here must have found it long ago." He scans the word-drenched landscape for Tawny but cannot feel her presence in Peepaw's finoir, and must travel to look, as if on foot. He finds the great proclaimer himself before he locates his better half, "Seeker, meet Peepaw."

Seeker is brought to a man self-made into a statue. He stands in an open pose, perfectly still at the end of his dream. He's painted head-to-toe in white and words—more decrees, printed over himself. They are non-sequential. These are the ideas he felt most important, at the time of their arrival. It is an uneven mixture of natural wisdom and imperfect emotion that buries his true meaning with inclarity, repetition, and overstatement. These decrees written upon himself are laden with fervor and presence, and change.

DECREE \#4,756 is etched on his chest:

No dream's perf  
Make urs a goodie  
This'n ain't good\!\!

Seeker feels wisdom, but also conflict. Reading more decrees—etched on arms and knees—introduce the boy to a strange man caught between the freedom of letting go and a love that holds on too tight.

DECREE \#17,886 is etched on his forehead: "R'mber to f'rgiv 'em or I'll n'ver f'rgiv ya." Seeker can understand it.

"This is bullshit. Let's go. I found it." Tawny returns from a distant decree. She doesn't say anything else. Delroy knows that's a sign she's in defeat—Petunia was right and Tawny was wrong. Regardless of whatever their quarrel is about, the tigress is a perpetually sore loser.

"Look at this asshole," she laugh-distracts, making the lunacy of Peepaw obvious to all. She hates that such effort was wasted on these meaningless declarations. "Learn to spell. Or make a dream with some colour\!" Designer Tawny is proud of her palette of dreamweaving hues. "Oh, wait. Too late." She knows he's locked in his creation forever. "Idiot."

Delroy doesn't argue about irony or artistic intent.

She rants at Seeker instead, "There's no point to any of this. Nobody else can decide what you dream, he says it himself. So, for all this effort, he hasn't accomplished anything\! I doubt that any of his 'bequeathed' dreams are still around. Why would anyone let this guy—," she gestures to the very deranged man hand-painted like a ransom note, "—decide what *I'm* going to dream?" She'd meant to say, "What *they're* going to dream," but her own wish to be remembered shines stark when reflecting off this sideshow's popularity. "Why do this, rather than something beautiful or worthwhile?" She whips to Delroy, "And you *like* it?\! Is this what you want *ours* to be like?" Tawny needs to know her partner's final designs, "A manifesto?\! A review of life?"

"No\!" She knows he doesn't, but it feels good to vent.  "No, no, no. Never. No." Delroy adores Taw's honest passion. If he were to *finoir* a manifesto, it would be about their love. He wants their finoir to be *about* their relationship. He's still looking for the means to express its depths. "I just admire the detail." Almost every dreamweaver is impressed with that, tigress included. "He just… put so much into it."

"Yes, but how hard do *we* really want to try?" Taw can stay in defense of quality dreamweaving, but only when it's for something poised. She is still mad that this sad man lost her an argument. "We can go now." Petunia's gloat awaits.

"Yeah, there are definitely more interesting finoir..." Delroy the tour guide is back from his break. Tourist Seeker is curious what else the well contains. "Let me show you–"

*Follow my beautiful voice.*

Seeker goes.

They explore a gallery of finoir. Seeker sees the ends of many, and his own potential futures. The well of perfect dreams offers countless phanera to explore, and nothing he can break, which comforts his inexperience. Following his guide, the young dreamweaver learns of possibility and outcome in a dozen beautiful dreams. They pass through goodbyes and surrenders, delusions and truths. Seeker now understands that not all dreamweavers get a finoir, only those who decide some final state for themself. By this, he sees that there are no pitiful beings among them. Only happy ones.

 Seeker is offered the wideness of human experience, and agrees with Delroy and Tawny's desire to explore it. He forgets about Joy and Bakun, and trips with his friends for a while. By chance, in a world of absolute mellow they find someone looking for them.

"Pierre," the two are glad to see him.

"Come with me," he leads them back to the surface.

*Follow my beautiful voice.*

Seeker no longer needs his guide to move freely through adjacent dreams, though he's glad to be led out by the shirtless Pierre. Those who sink to the bottom of the well must craft their own way out, or return to the waking world. Yet, the novice dream-walker has still not yet woven a dream. He must cease his time with friends and others to do so.

"Are you coming to save Callie?" Pierre asks as they climb up to the courtyard. No longer confined to the foyer, there are dozens more dreamweavers in armings. Makeshift weapons of branches and tools. They've adorned themselves with pots, both chamber and kitchen. A march prepares and Pierre is urgent, "We're all going to help."

"Should we?" Tawny scoffs at the effort, but it offers new challenge. If nothing stops The Unending Nightmare, all of the finoir will be destroyed or lost to oblivion.

"It could be interesting." Delroy is curious, and they come back from certain peril all the time. Despite the threat, the troubles of doom are no pressing issue for Del and Taw. They're here for *fun\!*

Seeker is terrified.

	*You can't possibly help them yet.*

His limited time in finoir, and dwelling on his own nightmare makes a slaughter of every effort imagined. "No\!"

"What?" Pierre stops. He doesn't make introductions.

"I'm not ready." Seeker will go to the library.

"Okay?" Pierre moves on. Nobody cares.

"See you later\!" Delroy and Tawny hope.

"Tell Zowell I'm sorry," the critic requests.

"Tell him he's selfish," his lover demands.

They join a group led by Michael—many of whom are likely never to return. They march away in disordered lines with nothing more than their want of good dreams to protect them. Del & Taw know that's all they'll need to come home.

Seeker relents his search for Joy, and stays cautious of further detours until he marches out of the courtyard and through the now barracks-like hall. He passes a forge of new fire in the workshop, and into a foyer of war.

*How long were we away?\!*

For the second time since the labyrinth, he feels as if great gaps in history have swept by him. Seeker senses time in an uncomfortable new way. It marks him and dwells.

The student heads for the library. He will learn what he must before it's too late—how to make a dream, and how to save this place he now loves.

In his pocket there's an egg, in case he gets hungry.
