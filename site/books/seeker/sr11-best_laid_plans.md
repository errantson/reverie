Regret dominates him. Ugly, sudden, and helpless. He remembers something important, but far too late. Seeker was warned about losing himself in dreamweaving, and he had failed to heed it properly. He moved on from what was really important without even noticing, just as Joy said he might. He feels stupid. He feels weak. There are no memories of his decision to linger so long in dreams. There is no time he can blame for succumbing to the pleasures of his own reveries. Everything just happened, and now here he is.

Seeker runs for the path, moving parallel to Callie's approach. The Unending Nightmare consumes more dreams as it expands, so he hurries at angles to outpace its encroach. When he reaches the path, there is only one way to go—away from the hungry nightmare. Dreamweaver Seeker makes way as fast as he can toward Reverie House.

On the way he sees a small mess of stones on the side of the path. They'd been arranged in an arrow once, but only he knew that. The stones were knocked by time—displaced from their original purpose. Still, Seeker remembers a flying turtle in a sky of clouds.

He stops for his friend. The Unending Nightmare will consume that old dream, as it does many others too heavy or slow to float out of the way. Seeker knows that unless Callie is soothed, she will take everything into the nightmare and he doesn't have time to save dreams. He must save what he still feels is real.

Seeker feels estranged from his former self as he moves on from the point. The stones came from more naive beliefs he lost since placing them. At the time he thought the turtle as real as himself, rather than of himself as he felt now. Dreamweaving renders the specific utterly meaningless and that lack of purpose grows with the nightmare.

He can conjure a turtle whenever he pleases. It is no hard trick for him now. With ease he can weave a dream to replace friendship, or hunger, or sadness. Dreams that can substitute anything he requires. Sentimentality is spared for scarcer things.

What matter is *that* turtle now? *Only a dream*.

He kicks the stones back together. Not an arrow, but a cairn—the meager remains of his tie to imaginary friends. Seeker gives one last glance down the way to dreamstuff, and catches the eye of a wretched figure in the distance.

There is nothing turtle-like about it. There is very little human-like about it also. It is still far away, but Seeker can see its grotesque form moving toward him. The wretch screeches, then vanishes and reappears as it runs through the trees on a zig-zag course toward him.

Seeker refuses to panic. Rationally, he bolts toward Reverie House. The stones are a good sign. He has hope everything else is still there. Behind him, the wretch is in pursuit, bounding as fast as its four bent limbs can carry. The beast screeches a pleading tone, begging his ear to hear.

The woeful noise repeats somewhere behind his left, then again on the right. *They're everywhere\!* Lurching from forest edge more wretches appear in their malformed shame. Each one is broken in its own special way, their muscles contorting their forms beyond human capacity. They chase down the path like starved strays longing to infect the lost dreamer with their potent sadness.

Seeker cannot outrun them. Not all of them, at least. A few nearer to the treeline have beneficially warped limbs. They are more agile than others and gain upon him quickly. One comes so close that the boy fears a stumble will spell his immediate doom. He does not know what will happen when these things catch him. He wants no part of their sorrow\! 

Frantic, he searches his pocket and throws the rubber ball which he found in the cellar. The weapon is real and consistent with his faith in all that he remembers of this place. The rubber ball hits one wretch in the head, and it is a pointless waste. Creatures like these are not deterred by violence, so the dreamweaver instead conjures them a dream.

It is a simple dream. His running-panic doesn't allow for anything else. Seeker imagines a great circus with a marvelous sideshow of freaks. Inside, the big tent is a place where those who can make performance of their misfortune earn fans from far and wide. They are adored for their unusual or cruel circumstance. Happiness is always possible here despite unique personal setbacks of all manner and strange. In Seeker's dream, one can always find a reason to be proud of existing—wretched bodies are just part of the show.

The young dreamweaver launches his circus toward the oncoming woe-beasts. Instinctively they veer, but their broken limbs trip clumsy upon one another. Several wretches are caught in a tumble and sent careening into circus life. 

Seeker gains breathing room but does not stop running to see the good he provides his pursuers.

It is a rough adjustment at first. Acknowledging ones wretchedness always is. It makes the wretch feel regrets of such permanence that most never climb toward recovery. Wretchedness self-perpetuates like this. It is obvious when observed. The paths we lead others towards dewretching will always be of indeterminate quality, and many do greater harm than good. Yet for these few on the path behind Seeker, the freak-show is just what they need.

The Wretched Ones make their debut in a midday display to a sparse and unappreciative crowd. They earn sympathy and careers as living tourist attractions until sincerity reveals agony for free. It earns them a wealth in friends and levity, a sight of the true human goodwill. It is worth more than any treasure. Their patrons pay in love.

Sorry dreamers soothe in Seeker's phanera for a while, enjoying their time embraced by oddity. It lasts long enough, but not long at all, before The Unending Nightmare claims their dreaming once more.

Reverie House is at the end of the path. *Not too late\!* Everything is still here. He can still help. He can still make good on debts of friendship he owes. Seeker sought to save…

*Home.*

Scores of people armed with the least are gathered in the front yard of the chateau. Cracked spears and chipped shields abound. Every piece of armour is dented and scratched. Most have no protection at all. Even from afar, the returning dreamweaver can see that they've all been through too much. It serves as grim evidence of a long battle coming to unfortunate ends.

"How long was I gone?" he asks someone near.

"Who are you?" they have no idea or care.

Seeker comes back to reality.

Despite a general shoddiness, the dreamweavers are substantially more organized. They are in small ranks with intention and desperate strategy. Leaders have formed. Most choose plans to follow. Seeker recalls some of both types in the library, before he lost an epoch dreaming of fairy dust. 

Everyone used to have their own plans to solve the nightmare, all their own special dreams worked to offer. In the final hours, they concentrate on greater collective plots.

There is a platoon—a regiment of dream protectors. They have been given the best things, the largest shields. Michael stands atop a pitch of dirt to speak toward dozens. 

Seeker does not know where he belongs, so observes from afar. He finds cohesion, with no individuals offering grand solutions. Personal failures have proven them *all* unspecial, and now their strength arrives in greater conformity. The liberated dreamweaver is fascinated by this transformation. They rejected authority but it did not prevent them from finding predictable hierarchy once their desires unified in fear of never stopping Callie. They forced the knight to play their leader. He reluctantly accepted.

"I'm sorry it's come to this, everyone." Michael booms. "We expect a lot from each other." He forgives. "Together we have a chance." His legion are nonplussed. They do not want his reservation, they want hopeful lies. "We *will* defeat the nightmare\!" They cheer.

"Protect the dreamers." commands Michael.

"Protect the dream\!" they answer in unison.

Seeker slips unnoticed past the reverie knight and his loyal dream-guardians. The new dreamweaver wants to help, but barely has the means to protect himself. Instead, Seeker returns to more familiar acquaintances.

Unexpecting of his arrival, they spot an old-new face. Unlike figures are working in tandem. Zowell adjusts Bakun's implement of Karla's metal while Del, Taw and Pierre maneuver a heavy crate, planks and a ladder. A little witch trundles one of two wheels.

A wild-head laughs, "Did you escape the labyrinth?" The question suggests it might not yet to be done.

"Bakun." Seeker conflicts over his mentor of untamed dreamweaving. "Why did you leave me there?" Indignant, he accuses the cellar of human captivity. "Where did you go?" Bakun had abandoned him there. "You left me so long."

"I got bored." The wild-headed man shrugs at Seeker. "You're kinda retarded, you know that?"

"What?\!"

"Pardon the language, but *slow*. Dumb\!" Bakun speaks hard truths with a mutually forgiving shrug, "It's alright. Most people are. *I used to be*. If you average it out, you're still better off than most because at least you're aware of it."

"I…I—I…" Seeker's intelligence does not matter.

Bakun invites him on a dangerous and foolhardy mission. He begins fixing a wheel to the crate. "In my expert opinion," (the wild-headed man has a lot of those), "The best dreamweavers are those ones who most quickly realize just how rigged other people's dreams are. The most clever figure out something they can do about it."

"I escaped." Seeker defends himself.

"Eventually. Look\! Don't worry about it." Bakun eases Seeker the Dunce into rank, "Hold this hammer?" and makes him a tool. "You just happen to be a follower. Seeker, right? What a name." The wheel fits to Bakun's satisfaction. "What a name\! You should change it. I did."

Seeker likes his name. "Where is Joy?"

Zowell provides a debrief. So many people ask him things that he prepares efficient updates for sake of time. "She's already in there. The monad failed. You're too late."

"The what?" Seeker doesn't understand what the sphinx is telling him. "She went into the nightmare?"

"Yes. Very foolish." Zowell doesn't chew the fat.

"What? Why?" Seeker needs worlds defined.

Pierre rescues the busier man, "Joy was part of the monad. It's a beautiful idea. I wish it worked." Zowell scoffs at naivety and leaves the two for more present concerns.

"How can I help?" interrupts Seeker before he's told why he's lost Joy forever. Pierre lets him carry heavy beams. They seem structurally integral. So does his help.

"The monad. It was a beautiful idea," he reiterates. Pierre speaks in the past tense,"Joy was right to believe," then laments, "The monad took a lot of courage. If I had more, I would have joined." He kids at self-importance, "Maybe if I had, then it would have worked?" A voter's paradox keeps him unconfirmed in constraint.

Seeker needs to get past Pierre's fanaticism, "I don't understand." It's surprisingly easy to say now. 

"Ah. Sorry. The Monad—all our minds as one\!" He makes a gesture from his forehead. "The golden dream."

Dreamweaver Pierre explains a radical idea to Seeker. In simple terms he conveys that the monad is a collective dream that all dreamers can innately share. It is unified and universal, alike in all living things. It is the font of dreamstuff itself—the collective will to keep dreaming, without an imposition of form.

"When you enter, it takes down all the walls within you and opens you freely to complete observation\!" Fanatic Pierre returns to tainted descriptions. "A complete knowing of one another. Forever, together, you are always the monad."

"Joy is now part of that?"

"It's a trap," dismisses the little witch, warning Seeker more gently this time. "A well intentioned pitfall of frailer minds." Her esteem of dreamweavers is hierarchical like Bakun's. She doesn't care how directly she insults Pierre. He's used to it from her. Seeker finds Petunia more personable than when she was throwing rattlesnakes, but isn't surprised that she too has a distaste for Joy.

"It's not forever." Del interjects to clarify with his finoir distinctions, but nobody hears (cares). Taw eavesdrops as the debate grows loud.

He fastens ropes and a defense, "I disagree." Pierre has no difficulty discussing philosophy while he works. He reviews his petulant friend and tries to find ways for her to understand what he knows, "Do you believe that anything can be pure?"

Petunia feels pure annoyance. "Pure means too many things." She dismisses its demands of cleanliness, perpetuity, and perfection—to her, purity is honesty. "Pure what?"

"Just… pure." Pierre is translating big ideas through a pinhole of language. The conversation shrinks them both to infancy as they try to agree upon an idea so long known, yet still preliminary in definition. Pierre's dictionary is missing a few pages. "Like a perfect thing. A perfect form?"

"No." Petunia sticks on the word. "Perfection? No."

"I mean," Pierre's thesaurus works, "Unimprovable."

Petunia ceases her rejections to hear him redefine the purity which he always equates with good. "Unimprovable?" The little witch knows what that means. "Something that can never get better?"

"I mean, how a thing can't be anything but what it is."

"Exactly as it must be?" Yes. Petunia believes in fate.

"Exactly." Yes. Pierre believes in destiny. They meet.

Tawny and Delroy love their friends and soak in both of their visions. Their finoir must be *pure*, as they now better define it after hearing their discourse. This meeting of minds renews their creative inspirations and they realize forever needs deeper layers they may still learn to apply.

Seeker only thinks about selfless Joy. He accepts that it's a matter of time before The Unending Nightmare takes them all, so she was right to try something brave. Avoiding the coming problems in the library was not brave, even if it had been good for his capacities at present. Through all their debate about the monad and Joy's failure, the boy is chewed by sadness. He feels robbed of Joy's reunite and doesn't know what forces to blame—himself? *Oblivion.*

Always, it is the void where he finds root fault. It is responsible for everything wrong. Without the nightmare nothing bad would happen, and personal failings pale to the be-all-end-all of a darkness which he can always blame. Once, as a lost dreamer he escaped it, but now the nightmare of vacant sleep has proven stronger than purity and selflessness, two forces greater than he. Dreamweaver Seeker fears a return to The Unending Nightmare.

"How will we survive in there?" he rightly asks.

Delroy answers, "It's not a finoir\!" His technicality's point makes more use this time, and so it is heard better.

Tawny absolves, "Which means it won't be forever."

The two have *died* so many times in dreams they've lost track. Delroy and Tawny know the dreamer's mortality. Impermanent as it may be, it rips them away from each other for epochs at a time. Nightmares have shred them to scant memories and turned them wretch before. They've lost their way, locked apart in the waking world. Yet, always one finds one once again, and pieces their other back together. They return and resurrect their love countless times—a cycle lived so often, they forget how their memories began. Del and Taw can never clearly answer the question of how they met.

Zowell knows when to cut losses, "Which means you will suffer for eternity, and lose all your hopes and dreams." Our wild mindscape is eternal, it is not defined by proximity to Reverie House. "You can return to whatever is left after the nightmare is finally forgotten." Seeker can tell time, that won't be soon. "Good luck," he offers in abandon as he returns to evacuate records into the high yonders.

"Don't listen to him," argues Bakun. "This plan is gonna work." Everyone cheers at the good lie. Nobody cares.

"What plan?" So far all he sees is bad carpentry and gusto. "What is this? Are you going in the nightmare too?"

"Yeah. You should come\!"

"Okay." Seeker is glad to find a place, even in doom.
