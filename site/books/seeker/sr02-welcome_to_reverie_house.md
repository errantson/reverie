Inside the house, Seeker is greeted warmly by more than a dozen kind folks whom he is made to nod at, shake hands with, or hug. The braided girl leads him through the entryway with a torrent of introductions he has no ability to register. They are amidst some group working as he intrudes. Many loiter around the foyer in rough disorder, blocking doorways and busying his view. Supplies, tools, and wooden chests clutter the remaining floorspace.

There is a blond goliath who grips Seeker's palm too hard, and a short miffy girl with an overstuffed bag. There is a man holding a chicken, and a fierce gal with her adoring gump. Then a pair of twins, and a gnomish figure, and a frenetic ditz. More and more appear, whom he cannot fully register. They are too many. It's all too fast.

Having come from the terrible isolation in his world and then the calm of the forest, Seeker feels overwhelmed by the parade. He remembers none of their names, or anything they say to him. It stays a blur—lost forever, despite how it may better serve his bearings. Their faces vacate his memory and the braided girl leads him deeper into the house. Blindly following, he now struggles to recall her name. If he can only remember one, he wishes it to be hers. "Joy\!" a voice shouts from over a stairwell railing as they pass down the central hallway. It's a rude man who gestures toward Seeker, then asks with a smirk, "New or returning?"

"New," she replies without addition.

"You're too kind," he laughs, "Good luck\!"

Seeker continues pursuing Joy, but can't help feeling a little less certain as he thinks through the implications of their interaction. *Returning?* He'd yet to rationalize arriving at this place (let alone returning to it), nor what leaving will be required. There is a lot he doesn't know—which wasn't a problem when he was by himself—but now that there are other people (who all seem sure of something he is not). Seeker's ignorance leaves him at odds with the situation, and so he craves understanding. 

They step into an open courtyard where people focus on picture-bubbles of various size. The orbs float in front of them as if held by an invisible tether. Some stand with their arms limp at the side, entranced by the spheres. Others take more concerted poses, exerting themself before the little worlds with obvious intentionality. A few of them even look artful while doing it.

Joy stops at the head of a pathway. It leads through the middle of the yard to a decorated well with a subtle glow. She turns to Seeker and gestures ahead, signaling him to go before her. The lost soul doesn't feel sure about anything, but Joy has made him feel safe enough to follow the instruction. Seeker takes lead, and she follows close behind as they let his intuitions guide them.

There are a million questions that need answering but he must start with just one. He steps toward the largest of the courtyard bubbles. Three others are already absorbed in its display. It shows a wooden raft on the open sea. Each of the entranced viewers stand limp next to him, staring at the floating sphere—though they are also within it. He can see them in miniature, aboard the raft. One is steering a rudder, another adjusts rigging, and third casts a fishing line. They dress differently in the vision, sporting tattered rags instead of their neat coats and cloaks. All their different versions seem unaware of his observation.

"What are they doing?" Seeker asks.

"Dreaming," answers Joy.

The faces of the three underneath the sphere's spell are nearly expressionless. They convey neither pleasure or pain—only attunement with their dream. Seeker's gaze falls upon the dream-orb again but this time he mirrors their relaxation. His eyes unfocus a little, but the raft becomes clearer. Brine scent wafts up his nose, and he hears a gentle lapping of waves. Water mists his face, as an uncontested sun bakes the salts into his skin. "Ahoy there\!" says the fishing-sailor, affirming Seeker's place atop a cliff on a little island. They can see him, and make him real.

Startled and unexpecting of his place, unsure of what is happening—he slips from the edge. Into the seawater he crashes, and his lungs still assume they are on dry land. Deep inhales of water burn his chest. The lost dreamer cannot breathe.

*I'm going to drown\!*

The reality of such death overtakes him, but its absurdity recalls him to recent memory. His sortie from the dream comes on instinct alone. With a great step backward, he stumbles into Joy as he escapes from the sea's trance. Shards of clay mug scatter as it slips from his hand. Heavy waves move through him as he contends with it all.

"What was that?" Everything about those sensations had been perfectly real. There was nothing dream-like about it. "These are dreams?" he begs for knowledge, struggling to recompose himself.

"In essence. Yes," answers Joy while straightening herself. He expects her to follow immediately with more, but she offers nothing freely. A lengthy pause lingers between the two. At first he's slighted—feeling like she's toying with him—but there is purpose to her patience. She gives time to catch his breath, and pursue at his own pace.

Seeker fathoms her reasons, and searches for a worthwhile question. He must ask something that will help make sense of what he is being shown. It challenges everything he knows. It confronts him with uncomfortable reevaluations of self.

If the bubbles are *just* dreams, then the world he had known—so full of pain and torture—was also *just* a dream. Whatever suffering it caused was also not real, and without that hurting he does not know who he is.

Joy makes evident how entrapped by *nothing* he was. Before her, Seeker vanishes to a point where he no longer finds any self-identity.

*What am I? What is? Why?\!*

Questions are all he has left to combat the loss of grounding. Considering how foreign everything about the forest and the house has been, he seemed more likely to have come *into* a dream, rather than *from* one. Ignorance of his environment remained at odds with what one expects to understand of the waking world. Thus, "Am I awake?" is an excellent (albeit predictable) second question.

"In essence. Yes." Seeker cannot win the girl's games. Joy yields her approach a little, "You have fallen through, to the space between dreams—our wild mindscape. This place is our shared home within it. We call it Reverie House."

Looking around the courtyard, he cannot argue against her word. Already he concedes to the containment of dreams and his freedom between them. *The place between dreams.* It doesn't sound so far away.

Only the last parts are difficult for him to decode. "Our wild mindscape," Seeker mutters. Joy nods to assure that he heard correctly. "Reverie House," he mutters again for another nod. These are just names for what he's seen.

"Our," he repeats, there is collective ownership to it. He wrongly assumes that this collective doesn't include him. "Who are you?" he asks, now seeing Joy as representative of this group he feels outside of.

"Dreamers and dreamweavers." She moves to a nearby bench and sits down invitingly. "Everyone here fell out of a dream somehow, just like you."

"My dream was…" Seeker can't bring himself to relate any of it to the girl. Resurfacing pain wells in his eyes.

Joy knows he is still hurting. "It doesn't matter," she assures him, "You will return to the waking world soon, or move on to better dreams."

"Move on?" That isn't what Seeker wants to hear and he will not think of waking. Quietly, he accepts bitter rejection. This world is another he will rapidly vacate. Reverie House, Joy, and all he has learned will be forgot. 

"Eventually, yes. No matter how hard you fight it."

Now she makes it clear. His suffering truly is for nothing. This beautiful place is not his to keep, and too soon will he return to the tortured wander of his eternal dreaming. Before long, oblivion will be upon him once more.

With an expiry pending his experience, Seeker sorts a long line of queries he must rush through. "What about you? What about when you wake up? Will you remember this? Will you forget as well?"

Joy turns to cough, then plainly speaks. "No, I won't." She smiles, "I'll never forget Reverie House now."  Draining the last of her water, she continues, "This place has become my home. I barely have another world to wake to anymore." 

What she says doesn't sound fair to the boy, who doesn't want to leave. How was she able to claim this place so easily, while he was likely never to return? What secret separated them? Fires of indignation flare.

"Is there no way for a person *like me*?" Seeker's arms cross in juvenile frustration, surrendered to foregone conclusions. Exclusion by pointless qualifiers were not foreign to the boy. He hated it, but accepted it—especially when it came to himself.

"No. I didn't say that," Joy fights back. His defeatism makes her angrier than he expects. It makes her cough again. After a moment for composure, Joy gestures at the others in the courtyard. Seeker spies a man and woman dancing passionately around a dream-orb that floats between them. 

"They're *like you.*" Joy softens her doubts in Seeker. "Everyone here is like you. They escaped from a dream, then found a way here on their own. Most who come back here do so, because *here* is the only place we truly want to be."

Seeker watches the couple. Their dream pulses with energies in step with their movements. Within its display, flashes of red and orange burst forth as either lover affects it. Intensity grips and Seeker relaxes again, but more intentionally this time. He lets their dream take over.

Romantic passions define the world he discovers. Seeker's form evaporates, and a volcano rages in clear view. From within a cloud of smoke, the boy watches as the two lovers shuffle and twirl on the magma's surface. Each step of their intense dance throws geysers of lava into the air. If they kiss, it will erupt.

Joy puts her hand on the lost boy's shoulder, which returns him to the bench in the courtyard at Reverie House. "They are here because they believe in this place." Seeker's attention returns to his welcoming teacher. "Reverie House, like all things, exists because we believe in it. Keeping that in your heart is the first challenge all dreamweavers overcome." Joy assures, "Then, nothing can keep you from returning whenever you want."

Challenge and opportunity excited a confused Seeker. "What do you mean, believe in it?" He cannot make himself more certain than he was right then. With a clap he declares, "I accept everything you've told me, without condition\!"

Joy likes the newcomer. His sincerity is quaint and his spirit remains adaptive. In her long stay at Reverie House, she has helped many acclimate to these hard understandings. Seeker took to them as well as any. For her own reasons, she hopes he can manage the rest of the journey.

"I mean, to believe in its purpose." She explains, "Imagine if there was no Reverie House, or if you never found that path."

Seeker knows he would still be out there, wandering aimlessly through a forest-gallery of dreams. Perhaps he'd fall into another dream altogether? He imagines returning to his homeworld, and sorely regretting it. Yes, it is certainly better that this had been his outcome. "Well, I don't know," Seeker is unsure of how to articulate his gratitude.

"That's okay," Joy assures again. "Whatever might have happened, I think it's better that you came here."

Seeker feels a warmth that completely disarms. Joy really means what she says. The loneliness dominating him is no match for it. The lost dreamer feels so genuinely accepted that he wants to cry. He turns his face to hide.

"That's why I come here." Joy doesn't need to be seen. "A lot of us spend our time helping newcomers like you find their way. The more of us there are, the better things get." He recalls the groupwork in the foyer. "There's no telling what someone new might accomplish. Unlike some, I believe it's worth finding out." Seeker remembers the rude man in the hallway with his well wishes for her hopeless cause.

All through their time together Seeker liked Joy, but now he was beginning to appreciate her. She is kindness incarnate—a true gentle soul that wishes well for the world and believes in unqualified worth. When she smiles at him and says these things, it gifts simple faiths that defend against his own wicked self-judgment.

"I think I get it," he says, not knowing half.

"Come," Joy issues, "let's go warm up\!"

Seeker doesn't feel cold, but he follows her anyway. "So, this is your job here? Shepherd of the new?" he asks, half curious and half jibing. It makes her laugh as they move back across the courtyard.

Joy likes him getting comfortable. "No. It's not a job." She chuckles into a cough as they pass the glowing well and return to the hall. "I do this because there's a goodness here that benefits the entirety of our wild mindscape. The people of Reverie House make better dreams possible for everyone."

Down the hall they pass a noisy workshop, and a quiet library. The foyer is still busy with people making boots out of scrap materials. Many more chat idly about dreams.

She takes a right when reaching the foyer, then turns about-face before walking through the opened double-door. Joy and Seeker enter the grand commons.

It is great and wide, with a stout ceiling. Shelves along its walls house everything but books; a wood-carved chess set, and primitive drawing mannequins. Stained easels and chipped sporting gear. There are handmade drums in the corner. What remains is decorated with a disordered array of bizarre artworks in varying quality (mostly bad).

Firelight flickers from a massive hearth at the far corner. Through it, he can see that it's shared by adjacent rooms. A half-cord of chopped wood rests stacked behind two overstuffed couches.

All around them people are doing things. They are talking, singing, working, arguing—living. It is a chaotic but comfortable place for gathering. Seeker can see how many dreamers have come here to connect in meaningful ways. The room is designated for no function other than for people to experience one another, and feel safe.

Joy recaptures Seeker's focus, "There are no jobs here. We only do what's important to us." He did not understand.

Seeker does not yet know what is important to him. He looks around as if he will find it standing in the corner. Joy ushers him to a spot on the couch near the fire where he sits two arm lengths from a well-dressed man humming soft notes on a panflute.

Dreamweaver Joy sits opposite Seeker and coughs when she tries to speak. It is inelegant, and revealing of misfortune. She bares it with such brazen vulnerability that the boy sees more strength in its honesty than weakness in her sick. "Excuse me," she whispers, drinking the water.

Seeker is sorry and helpless, and now also parched. He laments losing the mug she'd given him in the courtyard, and just then realizes that he had not yet apologized for breaking it. "I'm sorry…" he starts awkwardly, "…about your mug."

Joy knows what he means (and what he really means). "Don't worry\!" she says in boisterous over-assurance. "There are plenty more of them for now. Plus, you can always make another." Replacement seemed easy, if he sought to make amends. Her welcome continues, "If you're thirsty you can find more in the mess hall." She gestures out the commons, and to the right. "There's food also, if you still need it. You can help yourself, if you want."

Free food is oft too good to be true, but his hunger had not vanished since leaving the path. He does still need food. Does she not? Seeker appreciates the offer.

"Alright," he says with a politeness that worries Joy.

"I mean it, Seeker. If you need *anything*, take it freely." She speaks with an undue firmness that isn't familiar to him. "Nothing here belongs to anyone. Nothing can." Joy tries to impart something important, "It was never my mug. It was never anyone's."

Seeker is confused, but about things he doesn't think are important. "Alright…" he says again, less polite. "What if I don't find my way back? What if I get caught in nightmares again?"

"All we lose is time, and all we suffer is pain." She offers it not to disregard, but to dissuade his fear. He tries to say he doesn't understand. Nothing comes out.

Joy stands to go, but gestures for Seeker to stay seated. She reaches forward and they shake hands—they are real friends now. Both inwardly hope that Seeker will be able to find his way back to Reverie House—that he can remember enough, and keep faith to return.

"Thank you for coming," she lets him go.

"Thank you for being here," he lets her go.

Seeker yawns and Joy smiles knowingly. She turns, walks past the couch, and leaves him to coze by the fire.

"Be seeing you," she whispers. His eyelids grow heavy.

Fire warmth covers him like a blanket, and the sweet lullaby of the panflute eases him into a swaddled bliss. He has been soothed by the house and its comforts, cared for by Joy and her generous heart. Seeker is tucked sweetly in the true reverie, and for the first rest in many finds peaceful sleep.
