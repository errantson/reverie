Seeker is sorry to leave his friend, but grateful that they are both alright. The boy makes a conscious effort to trace his steps as he walks away from the dream of clouds and a turtle. He uses the sun to guide, and moves a straight line away from the soft hued bubble while searching for the path that will lead him to Reverie House.

When he reaches the dirt road, he collects a handful of pebbles and draws an arrow on its side. It points back to where his dream remains. Seeker does not know much about dreamweaving, but if he can reunite with his friend then he would like to try.

Leaving the marker behind, Seeker carries down the path as he did once before. There is no strong sense whether he is going the right way (or if this was even the right path), but Seeker does not care. He could walk along it forever and never shake the confidence he arrived with. Another world has revealed itself to him twice now. Once, he's arrived here by purpose. Seeker feels worthy of something, at last.

Joy said that returning to Reverie House is the first challenge of all dreamweavers. Now that he's nearly done it, does this mean he is a dreamweaver too? Seeker doesn't feel any different physically, but there is something new about his mentality—an uncharacteristic optimism that he can plainly acknowledge.

The boy walks past many bizarre and spectacular dreams dancing along the path's edge. Though, they are less interesting to him now. He regards them as one sees overly-fashionable people in a drab town. His eyes take full opportunity to soak their presence, but his feet never stop on their account. Dreams are less mysterious to him now, and he knows that the house holds far more than he can discover alone.

While he assumes blind luck found him the right way to travel, seeking the path always guarantees return. There are ways to get lost within the depths of our wild mindscape but the path is eternal and easily found, even if unknown. For all who seek its way, it leads them only in one direction. It takes Seeker home, to Reverie House.

The house greets him once more, and he smiles so wide that his mouth hurts. It is the most wonderful thing he has ever seen. Seeker is proud to behold it. "Hello," he says to the house. "Welcome back," it replies. Seeker is grateful and glad. He will see his friend again. He'll find Joy.

Across the lawn he looks for sign of her but detects none. No matter, he will find her inside. With eager steps to the door, he arrives and knocks. There is no answer. Seeker knocks the door again. "Hello?" Still, no answer. Like a peeping tom he peers through windows, but the barely parted drapes offer a rather empty foyer. There seems to be nobody home. After the flurry of people that were present at his first arrival, this absence is far from expected.

He knocks once again in futility, then walks around the side of the house to a sprawling and peculiar garden. It is less structured and more tamed—its flower beds defined by the places people do not walk, its hedgings a mix of whatever manages to survive. Everything grows freely as it may while the motions of dreamers influence Nature's shape. Some do better for her than others.

The garden aside Reverie House is an odd cultivation of foreign flora, various but of the most commonly dreamt. He is beckoned by a complete fragrant bouquet that's known only in a botanist's paradise. Nature's residence at the house of all dreamers is confined to the flanks of the chateau, the boundary of the forest, and the crude construction between the boy and her precipice. The fence has no gate. It's barely a barrier, and functions more as a guide. It is also a prop-place for well-worn tools; a shovel, a rake, and others.

Nothing about the garden's design exists to police entry or exit. Its keepers have long surrendered to the flow of life. Nature welcomes her trespassers at the garden. It is the way she prefers things now. She invites him in.

Seeker still stops at its threshold. "Hello?" he calls louder. "Is there anyone here?" he seeks permission to enter.

"Yeah, this way\!" some man shouts back. It isn't an invitation but Seeker takes it as one. He saunters into the greenery. An incredible feeling creeps upon him. The garden is centering. All of the awful and nonsensical thoughts are being extracted from his mind. The plants eat the burdens of his mentality. Nature strips away artifice. It cleanses.

Seeker walks through a maze of hedgerows and blossoms. Thinking of the turtle, he worries about loneliness in their absence. The garden eats that worry whole. In place of anxiety are simple truths which he knows certainly—that the turtle is safe, and far better for having known him. He thinks about Joy and is afraid something terrible has happened to her. Perhaps her sickness has taken hold? The garden eats this fear as well, and Seeker knows only that she promised they will meet again.

The boy slows as the garden feeds. He never realized how many thoughts cross his mind until just now. 

*Am I thinking too much?*

Counting his thoughts becomes untenable as their frayed edges are neatly shorn. He is reduced to his base. Nature continues to feed on his most radical conclusions, anxieties, and doubts—and she is eating *very* well.

In hazia, he finds way to a wide alcove of tall shrubs encircling a round of sitting stones. There are six of them in semicircle, and each is large enough for many to gather at. Nature abides this place to better hear what dreamers say. 

Perched atop the first stone is a strong but weary man, hunched in utter fatigue. He wears a tattered tabard, crossed in lapis blues and near whites that match the facade and roof of Reverie House. His head is covered in matted blond curls, hanging low—defeated. In his hands, a dented steel helmet. Beside him, a dismantled breastplate with pauldrons, gauntlets, and more heaped on the grass. Behind him, a sheathed sword nearly as tall as Seeker.

There is blood on the man's clothing, but no cuts. When the blue knight raises his head, Seeker sees a chiseled jaw and a bruised eye swelling. His helmet has been struck, its visor badly snapped. It looks gruesome, and shocks the boy.

So far, Seeker's experience in our wild mindscape conveyed nothing of the danger that this man's equipment and broken stature now suggests. Whatever warranted such armour and weaponry defied Seeker's understanding of this magical place (which had so far been nothing but edenic). 

Now he is reminded that all things come at a cost. "Are you alright?\!" Seeker worries a course too great for the garden to fully digest.

The man lets out a grunt for himself, then puts his broken helmet aside. "You know it\!" he says assuredly while stretching his arms wide. "Just shaking things off, that's all. Nothing to worry about\!" The goliath grins at Seeker, which would have been charming were his lip less bloated and his eye could move properly.

"What happened?\!" begs Seeker, fearing to know what ills one might avoid.

The strong man makes light of it, "Blindsided. Again\!" He scoffs, "Got distracted for just a moment, and couldn't see properly." His knuckle clangs against the impacted helm. Its visor is rightly busted. "A wretched brute came out of nowhere, nearly knocked me out. We called a retreat, but just for the day. A few didn't make it back this time." His laughter at the folly is incongruous with the violence Seeker is hearing and doesn't sustain through the blue knight's sadness. "Damn helmet," his pain transmutes to annoyance he can lay upon his equipment's failing. The knight drops it on the metal heap.

The boy hasn't got a clue what the man is talking about. "I'm Seeker," he says, thinking better to introduce himself before diving headlong into current events. Seeker offers a hand to shake, "This is my first time back."

"Oh man\! The newcomer\!" The knight stands up, knocking his sword from the stone. He moves past Seeker's hand and gives him an unwelcome hug that crushes his ribs and lifts him from the ground. "Congratulations\!"

Returning to earth, Seeker feels an incredible pride poured into him but cannot absorb it in surprise. "Thanks," he mutters at the magnitude toward his achievement.

"I'm sorry I didn't recognize, or... not recognize, or... My eye is very bad right now\! Apologies\! And, welcome\! Again, congratulations\! It's always a good day when someone new finds their return." The beaten knight gives short salute, "I'm Michael, by the way."

"Nice to meet you," says the boy, though they'd both forgotten this is their second dance. Seeker could recall someone like Michael at his greeting, but the batter of his face made it difficult to connect him. Michael meanwhile, met so many newcomers that he never bothered keeping tabs on any of them.

"If you ever need to find me, I'm usually somewhere out there," Michael gestures to the endless forest of dreams. "Whatever the latest catastrophe, I'll probably be near." His assurance comes with a resigned, but dutiful smirk.

Seeker remembers what Joy said about the people at Reverie House only doing what they feel is important. The boy understood that Michael donned this armor, and took these blows by choice. His promised return to that danger spoke to Michael's own sense of purpose, and earned an instant respect from the boy.

Michael can tell that Seeker hasn't a clue what to do next, but doesn't have a guiding spirit. He also longs to rest his aching body in peace, let Nature feed on his heavy mind. "Go on and do what you will," he suggests in vague fashion as he returns to the sitting stone.

The boy takes the hint and tries to find his own way. "The door," Seeker starts, "I knocked, but nobody answered."

"Aha." Michael is amused when he realizes the newcomer's predicament. "You don't need to knock. Nobody needs to answer. Just go in whenever you please. None of the doors in Reverie House have locks."

For a moment this confuses Seeker. He can't reconcile Michael's defensive steel with meaningless doors. Then he surrenders to his increasingly apparent ignorance, and says "Aha. Thanks," instead.

"Take care\!" salutes the knight as the boy goes. Nature eats Seeker's name from his head.

Hazia clear from the garden, Seeker is still calm. The garden is a pleasant place he will revisit sometime. Easily, he remembers Michael, but not the doubts that he sheltered. Yes, there may be danger but for now there is nothing to fear. Before the lost dreamer vacates, the garden makes snack of his last fear—the worry one's made a bad impression.

Seeker turns the corner of the house and walks back to the entrance. The door is larger than him, but now he knows that it's nothing. Muscles in his hand expect to ask permission with a knock. He only makes it to the handle, and then lets himself in.
