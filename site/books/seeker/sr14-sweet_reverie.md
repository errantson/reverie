All nightmares cease in time, and dreamweavers save none but themselves. Whatever good was done, is theirs to define—but not all things in our wild mindscape are lost. Reverie House persists, though it was destroyed long ago, and will again in due time.

No remnants of that chateau remain where it was. No ruins of whitestone brick and lapis roof. All of the dreamers who lived there fell to darkness and suffered. Everything that once stood was lost to The Unending Nightmare, which grew for epochs long after it destroyed the house of dreams.

Nature is the only thing elemental enough to survive such void, and it is strong where the garden had been. Its old walkways and bushels mark their place out of time. When the darkness retreats, it draws lost dreamers near with a few tart berries and it feeds them. They are confused and weary. They eat, grateful for the respite. Nature provides nexus and food. Each cycle beyond their nightmares, their relationships renew. In time they get their bearings, and dreamweavers repay kindness to Nature with care. Roots are lain and she is tended as they both recover strengths lost to misery.

Zowell returns from the high yonders with knowledge. He has preserved what he can, but cannot rebuild what once was. Not by himself or with what they have. They compromise and strategize. Familiar faces reunite where the garden survives. They make a work camp that grows legs. Reverie House will collapse again, but he keeps track. This one lasted longer.

One by one those who cherish it, need it, or simply enjoy the challenge come from wandering our wild mindscape and contribute to the building efforts. Those like Karla offer labour and those like Bakun do what little they can. Delroy and Tawny make a nest, and Petunia spends less time at home. The kitchen is the first thing they build. Then the library, despite Zowell's request. Ollie and Pecky are grateful to call it their home. More do too, in time.

Room by room they tackle old designs, reinvent, and improve. Piece by piece they reconstruct the reasons things were and welcome back others who turn from wretchedness in their own time. Eventually there are many dreamweavers who make light work of their lives.

Joy is not seen again. Nor is Seeker, rightly.

Someone new comes instead, on a day they are building dorms. He says he was, "Lost in nightmares. Lost together. Lost in dreams." The dreamweavers look him over, and they see their friend, though older. He is worn and badly needing shelter. They have plenty.

His striking resemblance is uncanny, and he shares histories of someone they knew. Familiar and friendly, they reunite and reminisce—it's good to meet again. Together, they build home and advent. He gives them every second of his time and his name changes as an old one loses its fit.

Unintroduced among the new, he is seen as just himself. "Keeper, was it?" is asked, then left uncorrected.

Those who hear the mistake repeat it in jest, but over time the name is well earned. Keeper fits his redefined station, doing whatever he can for others who need him. Some old friends still recall Seeker, but beyond the monad they don't find him so easily. Dreamers come and go at Reverie House, but *he* is always there. After a while, calling him Keeper at Reverie House becomes the simplest means to describe him—the most certain kind of name.

All who return are congenial, but none who claim victory. Those who had been part, played part, or come apart during The Unending Nightmare feel no triumph. None really understand the reasons *why* Callie's nightmare eventually relented. All they can know is that they survived their return, which earns nothing more than one another's most desirable company.

Keeper is still seeking Joy. Though, he ventures less far to find her. She can come home when she is ready. The house will be here, as will he. The path still leads the same way, and at its end he waits, welcoming newcomers in hopes of seeing his friend once more. "Thank you for being here," is what he will say when they finally reunite.

—

One day a girl comes to the edge of the path, barely visible through the trees. Her hair hangs heavy, as if she's been lost in the woods for some time. Keeper sees her while watching for familiar faces, and brings clay mugs of water he's recently made. It's his effort to greet her.

"Welcome to Reverie House," he speaks gently.

"Who are you?" She feels a vague familiarity in his presence, like they've met somewhere before.

"They call me Keeper," he answers. "This is a place between dreams. You've found your way to Reverie House. We're here to help."

"Help?" She does not see how.

"Yes\! Whatever you need. There's food inside." Keeper gestures toward the house, "You must have come from a very awful dream." He can conjure some better ones, or leave her alone if she'd prefer. "Happy to help with anything, at all."  
If she asks, he can teach her the secret art of dreamweaving or how to come back whenever she wants. Though, Keeper does none of this and lets the girl find her own way.

"Help me with what?" She can't understand. Nobody has ever offered this hand. "Help me with what?" She repeats undignified. "I don't need any help\!" The dark girl doesn't. She can manage her own dreams just fine.

"Me neither," says Keeper, content she's contented. He makes friends. "Do you need a name?" he offers.

"I have one," she says. The question is absurd.

"May I have it?"

The girl pauses, "Callie." She returns.

Keeper sees the abyss once more. In her blameless eyes sleeps the void. The Unending Nightmare cannot finish, only reduce into a girl with the courage to contain it. She has grown in a story of cycles, and now sits on a curve of lesser destruction. Tired is all she is, but too afraid to dream.

*To exist is to suffer and be glad for it.*

He forgives her cataclysm, gladly.

*All we lose is time and all we suffer is pain.*

She does not yet share his view.

"I am happy you're here\!" He tells her truly.

It disarms, "Thanks? You too." She is confused.

Keeper invites Callie and delivers the offer that all dreamers receive, "You've found yourself at Reverie House. Help yourself to whatever you need. There are no locks on the doors, meager food on the stove, and everything's free to use as you please." Gladly, he fills Joy's role.

"I don't need anything." Says the girl. Though, did he say food? That would be nice. "I'm just passing through," but she didn't know there were places to stay. She doesn't want to go back to dreaming. She has nowhere good to wake to.

"As you wish. As you please." Keeper bows, "Don't let me get in your way." He lets the dreamer keep dreaming, and she goes unconstrained. "I'll only be here if you need me." The man leaves her be, and returns to conjure dreams.

Callie finds Reverie House.

She finds herself home.
