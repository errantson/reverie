"Hold the line\!" Michael orders the guards meeting wretches head-on, "Shields together\!" Dreams fly overhead and sweep away the creatures as they press on toward the ever-expanding border to The Unending Nightmare.

Crooked limbs batter braced boards as the wretches lunge their misery en masse. The dream guardians stare down the beastly sadness face-to-face with a fearlessness against misery's demons. They know to never surrender. Dreams will come to save them in time as dreamweavers above launch colourful phanera to clear the way.

They ride atop Safety's Mistress—a marvel of budget engineering and hurried carpentry. She is the chariot of all dreamweavers, and stands a platform over 8ft tall. From a wheeled crate at her base extends a vertical scaffold of minimum standard. The plank it suspends sways its passengers up high as the base is pushed forward on wheels. Dreamt of by a wild-head and built by more contentious architects, she is their discount siege tower crafted as final hope of reaching the nightmare in one piece. The Mistress keeps them safe above the swarms of wretches who are each only one dream's conjure away from salvation. The dreamers' contraption provides them time, and a vision they can agree upon—ground where they can stand.

From the platform, artillery dreamweavers have an uncontested view of their battlefield. They roll down the path (the easiest ground) toward the swirling void. Their heightened vantage provides a sprawling outlook at the onslaught pouring from The Unending Nightmare, which they aim to intervene before it reaches Reverie House.

Michael and the guardians provide a buffer between the dreamers and pain. He orders his command to soak up all of the sadness that the nightmare-spawn spew. Long ago he ceased imagining better dreams for himself and learned to enjoy the dreams of others. Now he leverages his temper for melancholy to absorb wretched views. The knight and his dream-guardians bear the brunt of Callie's outpouring of misery on behalf of their better-dreaming friends. Some see the bulwark's gift as a sacrifice for a greater good. Others assume it's just something that needs to be done to survive. Stalwart Michael believes this is what he is best at, and trusts in others enough to bring purpose to his noble defense.

"Woo-hoo\! Party time\!" shouts the wild-headed man. His hands shake psychedelic jazz. A series of novel phanera appear from his palms. Each glows in abstraction, vibrancy and groovy good feelings. Bakun drops them like bombs on the onslaught below. The wretches are spun into dreams that remove distinctions between trash and beauty, others where emotion bids the temperament of surrounding. Wild-headed worlds flow freely from his fingertips and the sorry beasts leave their sorrow on dreams of patience, and freedom, and laughable cosmic indignities. One dream is made for thrashing a temper until it feels silly. The weaver donates these wonderful dreams full and fast, as his contribution to the war effort against drear.

Seeker cannot see much of the dreams that zip overhead. He can see many people's backs, most closely one shirtless. The new recruit to this dreamweaver's front is on duty to push. One of four poles extends from The Mistress, and along with Del, Taw, and Pierre, Seeker moves the top-heavy dreamers along. Karla's gears provide mechanical advantage but they strain against weight trying to keep their chariot moving forward. It is a burdensome labour, and they are burdened more by their freedom. They can quit anytime. They march toward and for dreamstuff, entirely of their own accord.

Still, the four corners of Safety's Mistress regret just doing what they're told. Pierre relents to Delroy, who always yields to Tawny, who considered Seeker, who follows Bakun, who didn't give them orders until the only help left was the hardest kind to do—the kind he never saves for himself.

Petunia climbed the ladder without hesitation and payed her share of the effort weaving gory nightmares for pitiful wretches. (This does not help them, but it gets them out of the way.) She tests the harshest and most malevolent nightmares she can brew, fulfilling her own purpose while getting the job done. Seeker does not feel like he is living his purpose. None of the four corners do. They tire and lose faith that their efforts are even worthwhile.

One of them—*nobody will say who*—stops giving their equal share, to relax and enjoy a less bitter end. Their wheel sticks and the corner of the tower lurches, jerking the platform and wobbling unsteady dreamweavers. 

A dream flies off-course and backstabs two guardians. One minute they are facing deathly wretched howling, and the next they are floating free in outer space. Caught in the dream-bubble they drift across enemy lines on pleasant delusions.

They wonder if they have died. This doesn't feel like the heaven that either of them wanted or imagined. They do not like the cold of space, the void of life. It is slow and it has no meaning whatsoever. When they come upon clouds of starstuff, they find ways to create a new world of their own. They imbue it with life-essence, and all life-essence grows. It flows through their whole world as blood, sweat, and tears. The two become all plants, all animals, and a spirit of haven. As star-children, they float away on this dream, ignorant of all the damage that's been done.

Michael braces the gap in the wall, but too many awful wretches are through already. The knight seals the hole himself, bearing shield rather than blade. Wretches are upon the four corners of Safety's Mistress within a moment as Bakun, Petunia and the dreamweavers above distract in adjustment and the wall-pressed dream-guardians are unready to conjure anything quickly. The other three corners stop, and they all quit pushing to raise defense.

One wretch is upon Seeker, it wails of infinite loss. The boy recoils, but the dreamweaver ripostes. He conjures a dream on instinct alone, fueled on a truth of tiring muscles. An atlassian physique with incredible ease, Seeker catches the wretch in a lie. The creature loses its worries while resculpting itself like a bodybuilder. This proves satisfying enough for wretchedness to leave Seeker's concern.

Others are not so lucky.

"Forget it\! Everyone up\! She's coming to us\!"

Seeker looks ahead and sees how quickly momentum can shift. Michael retreats his guard to surround the assemblage of wood and nail. The others (and the less courageous guardsmen) clamber up the ladder to test the unconfirmed weight limit of Safety's Mistress. Overhang of the platform is too wide for wretches to climb upon three of its sides (were their bodies adept enough to try), but the edges sag under the recent arrivals. Those who do not make it to the ladder in time are stuck in Michael's phalanx, guarding the only useful way up.

Everything grows dark beneath Callie's shadow. One shield gets pulled from the phalanx and drawn into a pummel of wretches. The woman attached to it is beaten into panic and pain. She forgets how to dream. Her closest companions are too busy fighting for their own sake to help, and the lucky few up above don't even see her plight. She is beaten by gnarled feet, and cloying hands that bleed their suffering unto her. They break her into memories, distinct bubbles of all her dreams that were—pieces of a fractured girl who was cherished. She loved to be around moving water. The mist of her life hovers for a while as the clumsy wretches wade through and gawk dazedly at parts of her being. Eventually she drifts away as fragments of herself, set on a long wander to reconvene somewhere else in our wild mindscape.

Delroy and Tawny notice the shimmer of the girl's memories as her tiny phanera spread a fog of war. More dreamweavers fall to wretches around them, and more mist of their fragments blanket the forest floor. The lovebirds know from experience what sort of things pull one together. 

They lob gentle dreams of good cheer, of good vibes, and good friends. Rolling through the mist, these wondrous dream-bubbles soak up their affinities. Over time those who can find common ground will come to be themselves again, and these dreams help their reunification.

Seeker does not understand what they are doing, tries to copy, but only makes fun. He lacks the lovebirds' calm. Neither Del nor Taw seem to care what bad thing will come next, but he is gripped in terror as the nightmare bears down upon them. He does not have time to confront being broken into memories or his own body warping wretched. The dark nothingness that churns within The Unending Nightmare is more fearsome than anything else to him. Unlike his friends, Seeker knows exactly what's waiting in there.

Darkness spans half of their world now and comes nearer to taking them in. Despite its promise of certain doom, the dreamweavers wish to go inside—ideally, before a wretch has their way. They still have theories of salvation, of whatever they can conjure to cure Callie's lament. They have the power to reshape dreams, but Seeker understands how pointless it is. He had to quit his own pains himself.

Michael's guard continues falling. The knight and his fellows are gluttons for punishment, but the sheer helpings of misery the wretches heap upon them overwhelms them completely. One by one they are wracked by wretches until shattered into the mists of memories, only to be sucked into the vortex of Callie's nightmare. If they ever came back as wretches themselves, none could tell. Few can recognize a friend in the wretch.

Slashing wild at a huddled blight of creatures, Michael bounds an outward defense. The blue stalwart knows how to lose a battle well, and also fears the coming night. Away from Safety he runs, drawing the wretches with him. "Come here, I'll take your problems\!" He offers as their whispers of woe lick his ear. "No, I'm fine. How about you?" he is hit by tens of their bodily issues. "Tell me more. Tell me more." Saintly Michael takes it all and never rests his selfless respect, his affordance to their dignity. The wretches have real suffering, there is nothing dreamlike about it. He feels for them, and becomes like them, and is himself a passage through pain. The Unending Nightmare approaches as the stalwart of Reverie House leads horrors away from good dreamers long enough for them to make it inside.

Seeker and the dreamweavers face Callie head-on as the membrane of her dark reality overtakes theirs. This is The Unending Nightmare, and it claims all your hopes and dreams. All that remains in her vision is the bleak obsession of the void—oblivion in its utmost power. Dreamers cannot think clearly as her world becomes manifest. They can see nothing but the desolation and destruction before them. Depression consumes them all.

The wretches are at home. They break their limbs in new ways, more readily making better climbing instruments of their bones. None of the dreamers can conjure reveries. Callie's world is a true horror. Forever it stretches in hollow. It is a place that feeds on dreams.

The dreamers are still high on Safety's Mistress, their shared belief in it provides a small bridge of common ground. Though they know nothing of how to change the bleak world around them, they hold on to what they still have from theirs. "We came in here together\!" Captain Dreamweaver Bakun is a voice of experience that stays clear through the smoke of blight, "As long as we stick together, we'll be fine."

Del and Taw have heard this before. So have many other dreamweavers. Seeker hears enough to stay whole for the time, clinging to this journey while the others provide. Collective faith in each other remains, so their bodies stay together for the time being. However, faith in the chariot's construction was always going to give out eventually.

A plank breaks. A dreamweaver falls. Their friends can do nothing to help. Through infinite darkness they plummet in the dimensionless parallels of the void. Seeker watches this fall through demented complexity and it hurts his mind just to see. He survives witnessing sorrows so great they are beyond sanity's capacity to rationalize. It reforges his perceptions in new ways that force mad lines of thinking. Wretchedness churns from within.

One then hoists itself upon Seeker—a horror returned in endless wretch. It is hard to call its shape, for it is not welcome in known geometry. Interwoven with his being, it grasps him from within him and pulls toward everything that is outside itself. It is he. It is Seeker. *It is you.* 

It takes him in and feasts on all his dreams, and then collapses on itself and vanishes. He has already survived this darkness before.

Seeker holds on to his place, himself, and his friends. A pierced scream rips his attentions instead. The concerns of wretchedness are gone, so long as he feels their presence.

*I can help*.

Dreamweavers cling to the planks of Safety's Mistress. Once an idea of dream protection, she is now just the ground between their faith in each other. Here, she is poorly defined. Pierre suffers at the edge, he looks for someone out there to cling to. Seeker sees but does nothing. Bakun tries but to no avail. Pierre's head bangs apart in frustration, as he bellows agony for all others to hear. They begin to parrot his pain.

*Don't give in.*

The wild-head surfs darkness like this for fun. "There's still a chance\!" Bakun beckons his friend, but he can't work his way through how. He remembers why his wildest dreaming started in the first place.

*You already know it is inevitable.*

Reactive cowardice takes over. Bakun shunts Pierre overboard. Down he falls through the voidwell, flailing like a dying snake. The wild-headed man saves himself, and Seeker hates how possible it makes victory seem.

"No surrender," Bakun the Fighter tells his comrades. They fall aghast into the nothing, or rise up to meet his level. A small sanctuary still remains, but nothing is guaranteed.

*Nothing.*

Seeker makes a choice. He will stay with his friends and resist darkness. He will not give into the void. In the distance he looks for options beyond death and sorrow, and sees the shimmer of gold out of view. Wretchedness is kept at bay by its light—a shining unity, a shared dream. Seeker emanates this light from himself, as do all of his friends. The wretches relent to this spirit maintained in hope.

Elsewhere, through the opaque haze of the farther sky, Bakun feels a pulse tremor. It's tiny, but distinct. Heartbeat of this world. *In-Out. In-Out.* The dreamweaver knows it's the dream's dreamer, the girl caught in the core of the nightmare. They can all hear her name, what she calls herself. It is the center of this nightmare's blame. Callie. Ominous gravity summons all those who seek to solve her problems.

*This nightmare can never end.*

The challenge is too easy for the wild-headed man. Bakun seeks a way to that source, where he will battle her dreams against his. Petunia, Delroy and Tawny are ready to go the distance as well. Seeker tries to hold on to his friends, but has lost so many by now that their delusions are evident. Still, he keeps faith in their way as he stares into void.

A prehistoric face breaches the layers of fog before his vision suddenly. It destroys his portion of the platform and Seeker must remain on ground kept by others. The great thing's jagged maw bites through where he stands with one clumsy, and ill-sighted chomp. The last dreamweavers of Reverie House contend with shrinking ground.

*All the dreams you forgot*.

The Unending Nightmare has eaten many phanera. The others recognize theirs from each other, and ones they've all been through together. Seeker understands better how the nightmare corrupts, as he better recalls his own dreams.

Through the dissipating dark fog, the creature swings around a great arc to face them all head-on. Its manifestation resembles a dragon, but only when seen through a stranger's eyes. There is something reptilian about it, but the shape is now all wrong. Wide and bulbous, perhaps once friendly, the creature now juts horns which poke from head and the back of its shell. It crackles with an offensive electric energy that is foreign to things of prey. When the beast briefly exposes its underbelly in turn, Seeker recognizes a scar near its heart.

*Hello, old friend.*

His dream has survived. Old and changed, but not forgotten. Seeker calls out to his friend, unafraid to risk outreach in the spectre of what time remains. He looks at the turtle and tries to see through the perversions that the nightmare has brought it. He feels sorry for not returning to their world sooner, for leaving his friend in the clouds to an unfortunate fate. The horns that jut from its back grew to prevent another like the boy from taking a ride.

*Stay away\!*

It warns with lightning crackling from its forks. None shall ever be welcome near the heart of the shellbeast\!

*It is me, old friend.*

The turtle has no way to recognize the boy. Even before transformation in despair, the dream-beast could barely see little him. Through impenetrable darkness, it hunts by ethereal sense. With a natural instinct and hunger for dreamers, it pursues and devours the few minds not yet surrendered to the nightmare's will. The dreamweavers are a tasty scent in the void. 

The shellbeast completes its turn and Seeker stands in its way. Through the crippling downweight of oblivion, he can still recognize his friend. Changes do not matter, their connection on his end remains. It is a belief that lives far from certainty, but clings in what he wishes be true.

He does not care if he falls. Not if he turns wretch. Not if his friend decides to swallow him whole. Seeker leaps from one friend's safety, and becomes something for another. He reaches out to his old friend.

*Nothing changes.*

Over a distance greater than any labyrinth pit, the boy jumps away from the other dreamweavers and toward his own dream—toward his friend.

*Shall we try again?*

He lands between the spikes. The turtle stabs and burns him. Lightning rips, and the transition to their reunion is not easy. They come around the bend of suffering together, remembering how they had once flown with ease.

*I know you\!*

*I know you too.*

Their voices come from the place between worlds. The true soul. The boy's acceptance of his dream makes a lasting sanctuary. Other dreamweavers are welcomed aboard.

*It's safe here.*

	*I promise.*

The boy and his turtle make good. Dumbfounded and delighted, Bakun and others rejoice. The dream-beast comes around and stops at their service, offering their transport away from the remnants of safety.

*Thank you.*

	*Pleased to meet you.*

The dreamweavers begin to weave dreams.

Callie remains ignorant of them.

"Take me to her\!" Bakun speaks, as he paces around the turtle-back. He holds on to the spurs as he walks toward Seeker. The boy's faith has made place, and their purpose makes it firm. Petunia sits with her back to a quill, giving weave to adaptive new nightmares. Del and Taw take a break in a nest made on uncomfortable shell. "Take us to Callie." Bakun makes his demand of Seeker.

"Why?" The boy walks and talks and gets his body back from absence. He questions the motive. He knows how foolish its errand. "What is your plan?" Seeker can theorize while the turtle's flight gives them respite.

"Let the beast eat her\!" The turtle is not offended.

"That won't work," deflates the witch. Both of them know The Unending Nightmare is made of stronger stuff.

"We've got infinity dreams. As long as we don't give in, something is going to work." Bakun doesn't mind losing himself in perpetuated madness but the others need more convincing. "I'm not scared."

"Why is more always the answer?" Tawny asks Delroy a design question. She is resigned, hoping her reincarnation after wretchedness will remember the good work she did on their finoir. Her moon-faced loverboy never wants less of anything, only more.

"You can't reduce oblivion." Bakun knows.

Petunia agrees, "It's amazing." She forgets the mission of rescue, as she stares into night with delight. The power of this nightmare is monstrous, and she seeks to wield whatever of it she might. Directly from the void, the little witch absorbs the depths of abyss. The Unending Nightmare shows itself to her, and for a moment she clutches at Tawny to keep herself from falling in completely.

"What is that over there?" Seeker asks about the gold, the light he still sees in the darkness. Bakun doesn't notice it, but Del and Taw do. Pierre would have known it on sight.

"I don't know?" shrugs Bakun who hides his intent in the planning, "Come on, let's go\! We can end this nightmare ourselves." The purity of what Seeker beholds rends the crowded voice null. "There isn't anything there." He cannot see it as clearly. "We should go forward. We can't stop now." The wild-head protests their moth-like attraction, but he is not who chooses their ascent.

Seeker follows the light. His turtle friend obeys his command. Bakun's objections must yield to the boy's knowing. "Joy is there," he says on faith.

*The monad is real.*
