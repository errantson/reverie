Seeker wants to find Joy. He regrets not asking Michael about her while in the garden, but thinks better than to return and bother him. Instinct says to check the commons where she'd last left him, but inquisitive natures override. Instead, he seeks to explore the supposedly unlocked doors of Reverie House. Joy will be found on the way.

From the front of the foyer, Seeker takes in the layout. The double-doors of the commons are flanked by a pair of stairwells, opposite a large bay window. The conjoining wall to its left houses a well-worn door with no handle. Across the way in near-mirror design the left of the foyer houses a library as grand as the commons, and a stairwell down where the boy cannot see. The center hall in the middle will deliver him to the courtyard where Joy had first told about dreams.

Seeker wants to go somewhere he has not yet been. The door to the left of the commons enters him to a large cafeteria. Hand-made tables and chairs (of various qualities) populate the area's fore. Another bay window shines daylight across and offers a pleasant view to part of the forest. The far end homes a banquet table with bowls and cutlery flanked by a door to the kitchen seen beyond the serving window, and an alcove with tapped barrels, mess, and buckets.

Seeker is still hungry. Joy said he could help himself. The boy is skeptical of such hospitality, but hopeful that her offer is not hollow or late. So far there had been no locks, so he approaches the banquet to see what's available to eat.

Clay mugs of various shapes and quality huddle in a wood-frame corral next to earthwear plates, and bowls. Some rust-spotted iron wrought knives and pokes sit atop many more wooden spoons in woven baskets, separate from the unfolded cloth napkins. A wooden pitcher of water sits invitingly before three serving bowls—one full, one sparse, and one nearly empty.

Seeker rummages through the motley of mugs for one he likes, then thinks about the one he broke on his last visit. Now he better understood what Joy said about there being plenty of them, and didn't feel so bad about his mistake. "You can always make another one," she'd said, which he considered while thumbing them and realizing just how many different hands contribute to a stockpile. All things in the mess hall seemed built by different artisans.

After picking a rather square mug with a good handle (one he would not likely drop), Seeker moves to the pitcher and helps himself to a drink of water. It goes down easy, and without permission (as all water should). He laughs at his own anxiety, imagining some tyrant barging in to berate him for drinking water without asking—the absurdity calls him to another pour.

Once quenched, Seeker rotates to the passthrough window. It is fixed above a serving station offering a small assortment of wild berries and a large vat of nutty porridge. There is also a bowl with one (presumably hard-boiled) egg. On the ledge of the kitchen windowsill sits a clear jar labeled 'SEASONING' in hand-painted letters. Inside the jar rest a few dozen very tiny dream-bubbles so small that Seeker can't make out more than the general color of each. He does not know what they are for, or how to use them. He leaves the seasoning be, and settles for the apparent faire.

The hungry boy plucks a wild berry and pops it in his mouth. It's tart and juicy, but only a little bit sweet. *Natural*. He helps himself to a few more, trying to coat his tongue with their unfortunately delicate flavor. It is unsatisfying to his anticipation, and his appetite demands more. Fetching a wooden bowl an spoon, he collects some porridge and takes a bite. It's even more flavourless than the fruit. Combining the two makes it something close to edible—free food as promised, by exclusively technical definitions.

Seeker eyes the seasoning jar with desperate longing. The awful porridge—*are these acorns?*—tastes worse than bitter and the berries do nothing to soften its grit. Hungry, but not stupid, Seeker knows he's missing an essential part of the dream-food equation. Marble-like, the dreams in the jar make him wonder if they're a topping, or if dreamweavers eat them whole like candies. He hasn't a clue what dreams taste like, and wonders deeply—though his trepidation prevents him from reaching out. Never before has the boy been to such an unguarded place, and he fears taking advantage of its deep generosity. Joy's words of offer echo as he debates the choice, "You can take it freely." How fully and sincerely had she meant it?

Although he felt a little funny taking the food, it was clearly left out for consumption. Taking from the seasoning was less obvious. The jar was sealed with a lid, and removed from the distinct availability of the table arrangement. Thus, when he rose to get a closer look, it felt a little bit like planning a heist.

Within the jar, the dreams radiate brightly with appetizing hues. Most are orange, yellow, or brown, but a number are in deep or bright greens. A few are more red or pink, but Seeker can only count two in blue or purple tints. He has no idea how to distinct the assortment of shades, and decides not to worry about it. There isn't enough time in his plan for delicate selection—he still feels like a thief.

Seeker cannot stand the weight of criminality, so moves quickly. Opening the jar as fast as his nervous hands can manage, he plucks one of the dreams. *Now what?* The jar is resealed and returned before anyone can notice, but he still doesn't know what he's doing. *Do I eat it?* He brings the saffron-colored ball to smell as he deftly returns to the table. It doesn't smell like anything. *Maybe it's not food?*

Before trying it on his tongue, Seeker stops and thinks to put it back. *I've made a mistake.* He feels sly and naughty, which adds to his moral uncertainty. *This doesn't belong to me.* Self-accusation leads to self-scrutiny and the confused boy is caught at a standstill, contemplating his course. If this is indeed a theft, then it was an accidental kind—only by his misunderstanding some very confusing rules.

Looking upon his ill-gotten prize, he watches its glow. Dreams are solid in the hand, but also a little buoyant. Like a day-old balloon it sinks in the air when he tests its weight in a toss. The dreams in the forest had seemed so much lighter. *What are you, dream?* Still standing in place, he gazes upon it with the focus he'd given in the courtyard. *What can you do?* Trying to see deeper into its hazy golden tinge, he focuses and the ball grows a little larger—still pinched in his fingers but now fitted for his palm. *Ah, I see*\! The more he concentrates on it, the bigger the dream becomes. *What else are you hiding?* Cupped hands bring it to his face, and Seeker finds his next meal inside the smooth amber dream.

Aromatic spices unlike anything he's ever experienced flood his nose and dance down the back of his throat. Deep into the dream he falls and his vision is overtaken by pervasive orange. When he lifts his eyes, the color is neatly contained in a bowl of carrot soup. Beside it rests buttered bread with parsley, two roast legs of duck, and a slice of pecan pie—all on an oval tray, its lid resting aside. Seeker's hands slide across the fine tablecloth and know a luxury that reminds him that none of this is real.

*I am dreaming.* He remembers this time, and feels more comfortable in unreality than he once had. As he relaxes, a cheerful man—*the chef?*—enters from an unseen place and brings him silverware, an ornate glass, and a pitcher of chilled floral tea. "Bon appetit\!" says he, before vanishing ahead of Seeker's surprised thanks. 

His first bite is of the meat. It's tender, with crispy garlicky skin that has gone a little black over an open fire. The soup is a creamy, smooth puree that overwhelms his palette with sweet carrots, turmeric, and heat. His bread is fresh, and soft. Seeker greedily soaks the soup dregs with it as his meal comes to its end. Even the flower tea, which had seemed outlandish to him at first, is expertly balanced with the rest of the food and leaves Seeker beyond satisfied.

All that remains is the slice of pecan pie, and the fed boy laments such a fine meal's ending. *Oh, to eat it all again\!* He wishes, and the cheerful man returns with another tray. 

Seeker takes the sight of him more keenly this time. The chef (role evidenced by his soup-stained apron) is short in stature and of moderate build. He's bald, which the boy assumes is a good trait for cooks, and carries a gentle and cheerful demeanor. Only when Seeker looks down to see the whole of him does he notice that there's a chicken following his every step like a loyal pet. "Bon appetit\!" the chef lays the new tray before Seeker, removing the dome to another meal set, just as he had desired. The boy gives his thanks, but it goes unregistered as the chef and the chicken vacate.

Now Seeker has his entire meal returned, plus the prior's slice of pecan pie. In retrospect it seems a lot of food for one person to wish for, but his stomach is not yet hurting and its taste was good enough to warrant tempting it. The boy eats, and clears his bowls. *Stuffed\!*

Flavours leave Seeker forgetting his place in the mess hall at Reverie House. He is reminded his place when a voice pulls him away from the dream, "I must have outdone myself this time\!" Confused, the dream-eater shakes his head and vacates the tasty vision. Before him is the man from inside, the chef. He looks more or less the same, albeit with different stains on his apron. Seeker stares in utter disorientation as he tries to make sense of things. Looking around confirms he is back, halfway between the serving station and the table where he'd meant to sit.

"I… I…" Seeker is bewildered, and doesn't know what to say. "You were in there," he says, stupidly. The chef has a chuckle at the newcomer's expense. Seeker grows a little embarrassed, and a little nervous—he remembers his theft. "I didn't st—I didn't *mean* to steal it." His stealthy operation has backfired. Here he is, caught in the act.

"Are you finished?" the chef asks with no demands, waiting for Seeker to hand back the dream. "Ah, yes\!" the chef is delighted upon receipt, "Carrot soup and roast duck." He takes a look inside, says, "Mmmm, yes," then shrinks the dream-seasoning from a melon to a grape. "Did you like it?"

"Yes\!" Seeker replies emphatically. "And, I'm sorry."

"What for?" the chef asks, genuinely confused.

"For taking it." The boy sees that it's of absolutely no consequence to the chef. "I don't know. I'm just… sorry."

"Aha. You're new, aren't you?"

"Is it that obvious?"

"Very\!" The chef takes a hearty laugh and introduces himself. "I'm Ollie, and you are welcome to my tasty little dreams any time you like." He marches to the 'SEASONING' container and places the orb back inside. Once closed, he lifts the whole jar up to the light and shakes it some. All of the balls rearrange, and he returns the jar to the sill.

"I ate some porridge," the boy offers.

"Now it's my turn to apologize\!" Ollie relays, "That gruel is about the best we can do for eats, outside of dreams. Our wild mindscape doesn't have the widest range of edible ingredients. You're lucky Maude found those berries. She's growing some figs and a few other nice things, but they take forever—a true rarity." Ollie dreams of fruit. "I do my best to make what we've got at least somewhat edible, but thankfully the hunger's entirely in your head. Soon you won't want for anything but taste, and dreams can handle that very well."

Coming back across the room, Ollie takes the lone egg from its bowl on the banquet table. "Here," he places it in Seeker's hand. "Take this—a welcome gift from Pecky." The chef closes Seeker's hand around it, treating the egg as if it were a precious gemstone. He remembers the chicken that followed Ollie in the dream, but doesn't yet understand the respect given to this rather unremarkable egg.

"Thank you?" the boy replies with some feigning from confusion. Then, realizing that everything else he'd been granted today (both real and dream) was Ollie's making, he repeats it with true sincerity. "Thank you. For all of it."

"No need for thanks, new friend\!" Ollie gathers the dishware from Seeker's table and carries them away.

"I'm Seeker," he replies, following to the tap alcove.

"Alright then. You're Seeker," Ollie dumps the bowl's remains in a compost receptacle, then places the cutlery in a basin, "and this is the wash bin\!" The fed boy moves to the alcove, and finds more than just his dishes in wait. The basin is half full with food-caked cutlery and dirty clay mugs. Whole ecologies have sprung up in porridge bowls, reaching advanced stages of evolution.

"You want me to—" Ollie is already leaving. When Seeker turns to see him going, he wants to follow and ask about a million things. Classic obligation keeps him in place. The washing boy calls after Ollie with his most important question, "Where will I find Joy?"

The chef stops, thinks, then speaks, "In the commons, probably. If not, the library or the dormitories." Ollie makes his way through the kitchen door. Seeker relaxes some, now he has direction.

Looking down at the dishes, Seeker also believes he is a good samaritan and properly appreciative. He convinces himself of this when he self-commits not just to cleaning his own mess, but all of the dishes which had been waiting too long for a wash. It isn't his job, but it's *the right thing to do*. Yet, the moment he is alone with the mountain of dishes, the boy is suddenly less enthusiastic about *doing the right thing*.

Certainly he will clean his own bowl. For sure he will\! Though, an inclination to ignore the rest of the heap begins backpedaling his nobler intentions. *Someone else* made that mess and left it behind—lazy people who didn't think it was *their job* to clean up after themselves. Seeker the washboy finishes his dishes. He thinks about Ollie's work with food, as elective as Joy's welcoming and Michael's defense. These were efforts that they gave freely for the benefit of others, and yet those others couldn't meet the minimum of courtesy in return. Seeker does not see how their giving can last as he begrudgingly begins cleaning everything. He does not want to be the washboy of Reverie House. *Nobody does.*

Whatever goodness comes from him is from the curbing of natural inclinations to vacate duty, responsibility, and common good. Seeker stays because he believes the work *needs* doing. This isn't what Seeker thought of when Joy said their works at the house are self-elected, but nobody else forced his care. The boy adopts a custodial mantle by his own free will, wanting only to keep the house as he'd found it. Janitor Seeker cleans the entire mess hall and receives no applause. Drying his hands on a linen cloth, he looks over the cafeteria and knows it will grow messy again. The janitor of Reverie House thinks to make a sign commanding others take better care but does not wish to impose an edict, as none were placed on him.

Now finished his labours, Seeker decides to continue his hunt for Joy. He leaves the mess hall as a tigress and her moon-faced loverboy enter. Seeker does not stop them for questions, and they ignore him completely. They are wrapt in a lovers' quarrel. "Hey, someone cleaned the dishes," is the only co-acknowledgement in their passing. "Don't change the subject," they return to their spat.

Outside the mess hall, the foyer has gained a few more people. They are coming and going, up the stairs or down the hall. The library is open, but the commons is closed. Seeker stands before the double-doors and hears many on the other side. Rather than barging in, Seeker stops to sort through his questions and pre-empt the conversation he'll have with Joy. After all he's gone through to return, he will finally be able to get some proper answers and he wants to be prepared. However, no matter how long he stood there, nothing could have readied him for the sight greeting him on entry.

There is a lanky wild-headed man bent ass-wise, and spanking himself toward a stoic woman who is clearly tired of the charade. A circle has gathered around their animated argument, and Seeker doesn't see Joy anywhere among them. "Go on and kiss it\!" the lanky man theatrically shouts while brushing untamed hair back under a red bandana that barely contains his mane. "Do that, and I'll know you're serious\!" The womans arms are crossed, she is annoyed on behalf of everyone. "Kiss my ass, and the head's all yours\!"

"Stop being foolish." The *very* serious woman does not have any patience for this pointless debate. She is well-built, stocky, and seems strong. Seeker thinks that, were the fight to come to blows, it would be rather one-sided. Yet, the wild man continues his clowning unafraid of any repercussion. When she speaks, it is on behalf of all those who wish for better composure and more sensibility to their discourse. "Bakun, you are being childish," she scolds, "We don't have another option. The head *must* be sacrificed." She takes hold of a small bronze bust sat on a shelf near their battlezone. "Whether you approve or not, we need to repair the armours. It's getting more wretched out there, and we are running out of functional equipment." Seeker recalls the broken visor on Michael's helmet. "Do you value this *object*," she tosses the thing between them, "more than others' safety?"

Bakun stands upright and snatches the bronze head before his adversary can reclaim it. "You're wrong, Karla\!" He rotates the masterfully crafted sculpt in both hands, and looks upon its intricately studied face. The bronze lady has wise, soulful eyes and short hair that is neatly drawn back to reveal her long face. Seeker has no idea who she is, but the wild-headed man remains explosive and passionate about protecting this image of her. He holds it up for all to see, "This was not easy to make\!" Waving it around like the card at the end of a magic trick, he brings some tooth to Karla's challenge. "Whoever made this," he hasn't a clue, "put in a thousand percent more effort than you will ever muster\!"

"It's the last of *our* bronze," Karla responds coolly. 

"Yeah, because you keep melting everything\!" A few in the crowd agree. "All you make are things that get broken or lost. You might as well just throw it away\!" He tosses the bronze head back to the ground as if it were trash. It lands near Seeker's feet, and Bakun ignores it to get in Karla's face. "If you want more metal, go mine some\! Go reclaim the crap that's still lost in the woods. Go do *anything* and put in the work, before you take even more from others\!" He steps back to land his final shot, "All you care about is satisfying people. You never care about what it costs them."

She does not back down, "We don't have *time* to mine. We don't have the people for reclamation efforts. You know all of this already. You're just being an asshole." Her facts go uncontested by Bakun and the crowd. She is more frustrated with him than outraged, annoyed by his pointless and purely ideological insistence. "We already have what we need, right here." She picks up the head. "It's a gift from those who had the luxury to make it, and I am grateful." Karla looks upon it with a craftsman's admiration, "Unfortunately, the time has come to use that gift. Nobody can offer another remedy for the metal we need *right now*." She daggers in accusatory fashion, "Not even you, who care so much."

Seeker liked the idea of everyone in Reverie House taking whatever they wanted when it came to the porridge (which there was lots of), or the kitchen's seasoning-dreams (which were not consumed). However, the ideal stopped working the second true sharing began. This bronze head was important to both of them for very different reasons, and it was impossible to satisfy both. One must yield eventually.

"Then we orren\!" Bakun says with the flourish of a fencer drawing their sword. 

"Seriously?" Karla is incredulous. "An orren\!?"

"Yes, I'm very serious." Bakun takes the bust from her. Karla makes no attempt to hold it. The wild-headed man sits it back on the shelf. "We're not getting anywhere, so let's break the standstill." He returns across from her. "Unless you're afraid of your own convictions."

Karla's dogma remains. "Fine\! An orren it is."

She takes a step back and pinches fingers together, focussing on their tips. Slowly, she spreads her hand open to reveal a very transparent dream-bubble with a soft white glow. When it grows to the size of an anvil she pushes it out of her palm and into the room. It stays floating between her and Bakun. Unlike other dreams Seeker had witnessed, there is no picture in this sphere. It inflates to a door's height, and looks like a large round window levitating in midair.

The crowd takes small steps backward to give the two some room. Seeker does not follow. He doesn't want to get caught in the crossfire of this standoff, but is so enthralled that he finds himself front-row to the action. Whatever an orren is, he will see it well. 

Bakun pantomimes to the crowd, enjoying all of the attention their debate has earned. He puts two hands behind his back and clenches his fists, then presents them to Karla. "Pick one," he says mockingly.

Karla is not amused. Karla does not respond.

The wild-headed man turns around with a spin and comes face-to-face with Seeker for the first time. "Pick one\!" Bakun commands, as he thrusts both his closed hands before the boy. Seeker pauses for a moment, confused. Bakun grows curious at his hesitation, but does not move. Seeker feels like he's being studied, then frantically taps the left fist. Bakun opens it to reveal another transparent orb. "Good choice\!" he affirms, then turns and throws the clear dream at Karla's.

Bakun's orren-bubble expands through the air until it matches hers in size, then slams straight into it with enough force so that the two spheres intersect partway through. This creates a large venn diagram in the commons, with both orbs staying linked at their joining point. The whole of it slowly spins as the two pace in orbit.

None in the crowd make any noise. The boy can feel the ritual of what they are doing. Seeker watches as Bakun and Karla step toward their bisecting bubbles. They ready themselves, and cross the threshold of their interconnected dreams. The bubbles turn opaque like bright white pearls, and then both the stoic and the free man are gone.
