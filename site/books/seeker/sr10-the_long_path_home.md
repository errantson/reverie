*Are they elves, fauns, or fairies?*

The lost traveller does not know the word to describe the creatures who stalk him through the marsh. All through his trudge, they follow and titter secret laughter on the wind. When his boot gets caught in the muck, it is their doing. When he stumbles headlong into the bog, it is them again. When he mistakes a ground of leaves and places his rucksack in a well-concealed puddle, he knows there are sprites afoot. Every misfortune that befalls his journey comes from the delight of hidden spirits who turn his folly to their comedy.

*Daemons\! Devils\! Tricksters\!*

Every now and so, he catches a glimpse of one. Quick sight of a movement, or some strange body. A hand on a tree or a foot in the brush will appear. Certain he's seen it, but when eyes narrow, there is only a funny leaf or a couple of sticks—a misread of light. These tricks play havoc on his assuredness and he increasingly thinks himself gone mad. Growing deeper unsure with every slight and distraction from these invisible spirits, he is drawn deeper into the uncertainty of the lost. He grows insane without surety.

Occasionally, he thinks there's a face in the wood. Sometimes it's young, smooth, slender, and beautiful. Sometimes it's squat, haunted, vile, or gremlin. It peers at him through a rustle of branches while he sits to rest near an oak. Believing his eyes, he chases after it, certain that he will catch his tormentors this time. When he arrives at its place, there is only an odd stone.

It is oblong, misshapen, and curiously placed atop a greater boulder. *How did it get here?* Wary, he does not touch it for fear of curses. At angles he tries to find a face within the stone to justify approach, but he cannot prove sanity. He is unable to place any eyes or mouth. There is no reason to his irrational belief in fairies. Elves work no spells on him, they are only children's tales.

Only the stone's odd placement can be accused of magic. As unnatural as it seems, it is not supernatural. Aloud he shouts in abjected frustration just in case his mystical accusations are true. "Show yourselves\!"

Foolish, he feels.

"No," they do not shout back.

Fool he is.

All he wants is to get home. He's been gone for a very long time. He can't remember why. The journey is confused and protracted, he was detoured and delayed. Worst of all, it has been utterly meaningless. His purse is no richer for his travel, and his bags less full than at his depart. His body has grown weaker in age, and his mind is no fuller of sense. In too many ways to justify, he is the same as he began. The whole venture had made him patently worse.

"Please, pixies\! Please, spirits\!" calling out, he begs, "Torment me no longer\! If I have caused you any grievance, then I sincerely apologize. If I have caused offense, then I beg your forgiveness." He drops to his knees, letting them soak in the mud. "I am just one on my way, and my heart yearns to go *home*." Hands clasp together, praying for freedom from forces he cannot see. "Just let me home."

No voice answers. 

"If this is your entertainment, then I accept mercy at your satisfaction. Take your fill of my miseries but then be done with me\! Let me show you the amusement of my life\!"

Again, no voice answers.

The lost traveller rises from his declaration, then continues his searching for home. With the sun to guide, he wanders an easy path—much easier than the rest of his journey thus far. The marsh dries, and grass shortens as he wanders without impediment into a secret grove. It is of soft moss and emerald clovers, dotted with miniature pink and blue flowers. Fey powers show themselves in beauty.

Stepping lightly through the grove, he feels the elfen presence once again. The children's stories are true. Sanity doesn't know any way to recover. He accepts knowing treaty. He fears no dwarfs underfoot. Around him trees grow dense until he is encircled, hugged, by the woods themselves. It is a mutual embrace, as the cage of the grove shades away his prior guide—the sun. 

In the distance is a clearing which is still allowed to shine. The lost traveller draws near in hopes of clarity. He believes he's being shown the way. When he arrives, there is a circle of toadstools growing in a round. They offer a grassy bed, wide enough for the tired to lay in. He knows the story's warning—a fairy tale of wishes got. A warning never to ask for what one is not willing to pay for. The traveller knows it is a bargain for agency, he remembers every fable's moral. When the barter arrives, he accepts it gratefully. 

The journey will carry on after a rest. This is such a sweet place to break. In-out, his heart has gone on for too long and now it craves longer beats with greater pause.

*A turn for your song.*

The voice doesn't come from anywhere. It is neither a sound or a sign. It arrives to him from a place heard only by the true soul. There is a wall between himself and the voice made from his remaining fear of losing sanity.

*Even if it makes no sense.*

Slowly he creeps towards the ring. Is this what he asked for? He offers himself as their plaything and fairies simply oblige. *At your request*. Says the dreamer, ready to let the unknown take him on dreams. Into the circle he crawls, and so dissolves the division of old laments and new truths until he falls to a place beyond form—through sleep.

*I must choose.*

The traveller is an echo of himself, and his intentions. Around him is the truth of his being. In-out it breathes, from the source. The lost one is the essence of all that surrounds, which can hardly be fathomed beyond shapes and angles. The liberated dreamer floats in a realm that means nothing to sight and sound.

*What now?*

The voice is clear, expectant. He does not know if he is speaking, or thinking. He knows the voice is himself.  Intention is conveyed without the hurdle of words and desire itself forms all of his questions.

	*Why me?*

There is no further answer. All the pixies have gone. There is no magic but his own. It feels like punishment.

*Why not?*

Infinity begins to churn, and the pursuant shadow reveals itself once more. The nightmare resumes. Oblivion again asks familiar option—something or nothing?

Entropy has a far better offer this time:

***\~ Everything\! \~***

Endless multitudes expand. They are perfect and whole. It makes him greedy for flawless forms and angry at the imperfection of everything real. On the instinct of desire his presence flies through every fulfilling dimension, always exactly where he wants to be. Seeking the truest version of himself, he guides life through infinity so far that the everpresent void lingers only as a distant and impossibly small speck. Infinity provides everything and anything until his spirit grows tired of choice once again.

*What else is there?*

He finds nothing more than *all*.

The void catches up. A choice returns.

Back unto the infinite he flies away from it.

*What about things?*

	*What about people?*

	*What about life?*

In the brilliance of all things, he becomes all things. He chooses whatever he will be. One by one, pieces of this infinite form fall away into sublime reverie. Shrinking small, he fits into tinier versions of himself. The lives he discovers survive on tighter wavelengths, hidden realities between the folds of existence. Always, they are caught on the narrow line between vastness and the end.

Ties to things slip away. No matters of body, mind, or heart cling to him any longer. Through meaningless lifetimes on the infinite, he drifts on whims of his heart, lost as he has always remained. One forgets fairies and magic, as they learn the magic of their own, and abandon journeys taken long ago. Forever lost in reverie, creator within their creation.

*What now?*

Calling to the universe, he hears nothing back.

*What now?*

It offers him anything, but he wants what is real. 

*What now?*

The spirits are his own shadow.

*What now?*

He looks for the light that cast them.

*What now?*

It leads him to a place he calls home.

*Home.*

Somewhere through infinity, just before oblivion.

Dreamweaver Seeker returns to our wild mindscape by his own free will. Unlike times prior, he exits this dream with the poise of agency. He steps away, in total control.

He looks upon the fairy dream trapped in its phanera. The little bubble is a pretty bobble—fantasy kept in an orb. But, there is no cause to linger on it. It's nothing to him now. As a dreamweaver, Seeker can conjure a dozen dreams just like it. *Better dreams.* Dreams he actually *wants* to have. 

Except, he doesn't want dreams. He is tired of dreams. Eagerness pervades the dreamweaver seeking return to Reverie House. The practiced dreamer has grown bored of airy dreams. He longs for familiar friends and solid ground.

Seeker reorients in our wild mindscape. The trees are as he expects, as are the other idle dreams floating sparsely throughout. The forest welcomes him as it always has, but it is in clear duress. There is direction in the wind.

Not-so distant, he sees darkness spanning the gulf of his view. He knows instantly the peril that everyone else had rightly feared. The Unending Nightmare. Callie's nightmare. Whoever she may be, Seeker does not know. But, he knows the darkness of that dream on sight.

The dream's phanera is colossal. It is so heavy that it sets into the earth as a horizon-spanning dome of darkness. The world-consuming void swirls like a captured tempest, and it is always growing, eating more of our wild mindscape. Seeker can see its gains clearly. The nightmare is advancing. Further trees and dreams vanish into the dark hollow as the dreamweaver runs from it, in fear for himself.

The Unending Nightmare is clear to Seeker. It is as clear now as when he dreamt it himself. Total oblivion, only larger. He fears it more than ever. Desperately, he does not want to experience its wretched pains again but now he has something to lose.

The dreamer runs to Reverie House.
