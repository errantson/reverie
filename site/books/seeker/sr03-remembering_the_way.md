Voluminous clouds abound his newest dream. Everything is a heaped, white, pillowy sky. It's beautiful.

As he soars through the clouds, rays of sunshine peek through and brighten the patterns of a gargantuan turtle's shell. They are shimmer-coated in cloud dew.

Seeker rides atop this great turtle, and the two fly with ease through the sky. They do this because they are friends. The gravity of their friendship is enough to keep them tethered as they loop and roll midair. It's marvelous fun feeling the wind whip past, as they soar without a care.

Drifting, Seeker thinks about how wonderful it is to have a friend. He doesn't know if the turtle can fly without him, or if he could fly without the turtle. Since they began, neither had ever bothered to try. Already it is clear that flying was possible together, and there was no desire to separate. Neither could fathom a good reason to go it alone.

Far up, there is an undesired sound. Stormy rumbling shakes his chest, and dread befalls him. He does not know how the turtle feels, but his own worry is great enough for the both of them. There is something sinister in the darkness that permeates ahead. It reeks of oblivion.

With nowhere to hide, the boy realizes just how vulnerable they are. Crackling thunder intimidates him as he realizes there's no avoiding its approach—all around them is more of the same. The white brilliance that once surrounded is now shaded in gloomy grays that the sunlight cannot poke through. Nothing can spare them from the oncoming squall, which harshens their course with fearsome gales. Optionless, he soaks in the torrents of rain that pour down. There is no shelter in the clouds, only each other. Silently, they agree that they've made a big mistake—they never should have flown so high or far. They will be in the thick of it soon, and it's far too late to turn back. If they are to survive this storm, it will be a matter of luck.

Electrical energies mount, and a sharp metallic smell accompanies. Drying off will be no trouble should the sun ever return, but Seeker and the turtle doubt their ability to withstand electrocution. They hear thunder rumbling closer and flashes of light briefly charge the smoke-gray clouds to sharpened silver. A zap tears the sky in two, making clear how a single lightning strike can rip through either of them. It would leave nothing but a fried husk. Seeker does not want this to happen to his friend, but what can he do? He cannot yell the storm away. He has nothing to challenge the sky. His pockets are as empty as his hopes. Apart from his own self and companionship, he has naught. There is nothing to offer the danger. There is nothing to offer his friend.

One bolt comes too close for comfort and Seeker is haunted with a vision of the turtle, shocked to a burnt crisp. *This cannot be\!* His new friend is too precious—more rare than anything he's ever known, and more important than anything he's ever cared for. Seeker values his turtle-friend more than life itself. Returning to solitude would be a worse fate than death. Even if they never fly again, he wants his friend to survive. He wants his friend to live\!

Lightning is a lot like lazy people. It seeks the path of least resistance. No matter what options are available, it will always take the easiest route. Apathetic efficiency is what brings the majority of its destructive potential. Powers of such wanton energy can be channeled, but something must always offer an easiest way. Knowing this gives Seeker a *very* bad idea. It might keep his new friend safe. The boy will make himself an easy target, and bear the brunt of what's to come.

At no time does Seeker worry about falling off the turtle's shell. Whatever gravity keeps them together is made of their friendship, which has not yielded in the slightest. Although the turtle-back is slippery and sheer, the boy has no trouble holding his place. Even when the winds whip their hardest, his feet steady as if standing on fair roads. Seeker plants both legs and raises his posture to a full-upright. Standing tall, he erects himself like a sail mast and takes as much verticality as he can. His head tilts back to grow just a little taller and his arms extend outward through the fingertips—opening to a crucifixion. All of this makes him substantially more vulnerable to the sky. Its ions notice and a natural magnetism draws charge in his direction. This is precisely what the self-sacrificing boy wants. Challenging the storm to strike him down and spare his companion, he offers himself to appease forces beyond his control.

*Spare my friend\! Kill me if you must\!*

The storm is willing to oblige his barter. A sadistic glow of static prepares to deliver. Still pointing skyward, Seeker welcomes the trade. As he awaits his ending, there is pride in himself—not for giving his life, but for recognizing a treasure worth protecting. The boy believes in the purpose of this friendship. It reminds him of an innate good.

The turtle has never seen the boy. Seeker is too small on the middle of its wide back and turtle-eyes are so far apart, their turtle-necks so inflexible. Seeker doesn't realize, but the turtle has spent their time with the boy existing only in its turtle-mind. All along, the turtle flew on pure faith that Seeker was more than a figment of its imagination. Its turtle-heart feels their friendship without proof.

Despite having no proof of his existence or awareness of any self-sacrifice, the turtle matches Seeker's choice. With a great heave of its body, the turtle spins and flips itself over. A soft and wide underbelly is exposed to the looming storm. If the lightning strikes, the turtle will absorb it and *he* will be protected.

Upside-down, dangling beneath the flipped turtle, Seeker is shielded from the downpouring rain. He is bewildered by the topsy-turvy upset, and takes a moment to recalibrate to his inversion. When he realizes what the turtle has done, the boy hypocritically rages against his dear friend's selflessness and scurries on all fours across the shell. It is not difficult. The gravity of their friendship is stronger than ever. Seeker climbs over turtle-belly and stands self-righteous before his kindred—face to turtle-face, for the very first time.

"There you are\!" says the turtle, "I never doubted you existed for a moment."

"Stop\! You can't do this\!" shouts Seeker who does not speak turtlish.

"You need to go back now," says the turtle who does not speak human.

It's useless. Seeker cannot bargain with his friend, or express any of the reasons for his wanting their safety. He cannot make clear the purpose of his sacrifice, or lend any understanding of how he'd rather die than lose what they have. The turtle knows that flipping once more will only have the boy scramble up its sides once again. They are stalemated in stoic defense of one another, and the storm is moved by their courageous acts of friendship. Perhaps the lightning will break old habits and strike twice the same place—once apiece—just to honor their devotion.

Tears hide in the rain as Seeker realizes the end of their time together is nigh. Whichever of them will perish, the other will follow into a misery worse than death. It is a profound gift to Seeker, who now finds so much purpose in what they share—the freedom they enable for one another. Only now at the end of their lives does he fully understand how valuing this friendship more than himself gives greater meaning to both of them because it's returned. From deep in his heart, this reciprocity elevates them both to more than what either can be alone. Friendship brings them purpose.

There had been no purpose in Seeker's prior dreams. There was never a reason for his pains. Only here and now was he accepting them so willingly, and it gave everything else value—even suffering.

Seeker's thoughts transcend and he realizes that giving of himself is worthwhile at any scale. It does not require such grave stakes. It does not need his life. Simple acts at any altitude can feed a mutual benefit, and give reason for our existence.

*This is the meaning of friendship.*

Crashing through him then, a great bolt of lightning eviscerates the boy. Seeker is torn apart by the malicious storm. It is very painful and makes existing his enemy. The boy becomes discombobulated into floating motes of smoke and dust. Each fragment of what remains sorely wishes it were still whole. There is no more will to endure the divisions from friend, from self, from life. Seeker is ready to depart forever, but oblivion does not come.

His natural senses urge his return to a waking world but he remembers something else this time. Somewhere he finds greater purpose. Seeker's lingering presence imagines a better place to go—a place where caring for one another can create a sanctuary, and empathy can empower great deeds. The place is remembered only in the root of his being, but it is as true to him as any other. Pain subsides. Death subsides. Oblivion subsides. He begins drawing toward that vision.

Falling away from his friend, Seeker says goodbye to the turtle. The boy's spirit flies away, leaving no remnants but a scar which marks where he'd been—so near to his dear friend's heart. The turtle knows the boy is leaving, and too quietly says goodbye.

*Be seeing you\!*

Seeker's consciousness falls away from the world of clouds until he comes once again to the soft forest floor of our wild mindscape. He has returned, just as Joy kindly said he might. Now, he remembers it all; the place between dreams, the forest path, the art of dreamweaving, and a shared home for all dreamers—Reverie House.

He laughs aloud in total elation. Unprecedented relief, excitement, and accomplishment radiate through him. Never before has he felt such mastery over life and fate. Sitting up, he gazes over the dream-bubble he has come from. Softly, it glows with the cream-orange and blushing-pinks of a recovering sunrise. Closer, he sees the somber grace of a turtle who now knows that it can fly alone.
