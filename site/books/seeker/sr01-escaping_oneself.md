Through endless nightmares, he runs. Infinite worlds pour from his mind and into the space before him as he races through each, and unto the next. All the while, pursued by an encroaching darkness which he dares not turn to see. 

Every stride is a strained leap between bizarre and self-defined horrors, his mind desperately conjuring fresh realities of unimaginable absurdity from each of his frenetic thoughts. There is no choice but to let insanity overwhelm him, to let the most ridiculous and nonsensical things take total control. Embracing lunacy is the only way to outrun whatever it is that's hunting him.

None of the worlds he falls upon are rational. One moment he's sprinting through a literal fog of indecision, clothes growing heavy with the damp of regret. The next, he slides down an avalanche of every face he's ever seen while the sky above shifts between hues he has no name for\! Every time he repositions his thinking, another abstract dimension forms itself and he's thrown headlong into it.

Momentum staves oblivion. Any new thought will do to escape the deadness which follows. It doesn't matter how painful or destructive. Nothing but *motion* matters. 

As soon as he pauses, it's upon him. The boy glances over his shoulder to face what he fears. The blackness which envelops him strikes primordial terror because it isn't really black. It isn't anything at all—just *nothingness*. Within its depths, he sees an abyss so pure and cold that it pulls his soul with the promising serenity of total nullification.

Quiet ends overtake his thoughts, but an intrusive worry appears. Already he accepts that this void will be his death, but now he fears it will hurt even more than running. Terror manifests new reality, and he lands on brittle ground. It cuts like jagged razors. Pain narrows his focus and snaps him forward, away from the absence. Existence floods with sharp edges, and a single point of searing light. Far in the distance, it beckons. He moves.

Darkness retreats halfway and experience grows new prominence once again. They wrestle until he is bisected between total agony and the absolute hollow. That is all there is left once the novelty and complexity of everything else has worn away—pain or death.

Between the two he rotates in cycles, but the ends are all the same; to exist is to suffer and be glad for it because the alternative is no existence at all. He ponders this for seconds or centuries, and then comes to a profound conclusion: 

*This cannot be real.*

What purpose is this choice given to him? Why does he have any agency at all? If he can *choose* between death and pain, then there remains a *reason* for his option. There must be some *reason* for his being, and for going on and on.

But, what engine demands his acceptance of torment? What force needs his continuity? Who is making him hurt?\! Imagining the subjection as an external, he can conquer it. When he accuses himself, everything stops all at once.

Disillusioned with the very nature of being, no thoughts of new worlds come. Freely, his mind slips through the narrow crease between sovereignty and self-subjection. He lets go of control and desire, loses fear of the unknown. Slowly, he falls between the membrane that separates him from himself. Darkness concedes as he fades away from all and everything that was. It feels like falling asleep.	

Green, then. Eyes open to a canopy of rustling leaves sparsely covering an expanse of clear blue sky. Fresh air revitalizes him from within as temperate sunshine warms his skin to comfort. Beneath him is a soft soil, gentle with dry moss and short grass. Wherever he is now feels vibrant and healthy. He is aponic. *This is a good place to be\!*

Sprawled on the earthen bed, he lays awash in peace. It will take a decision to rise, and for once he doesn't need to make any choices at all. There is no greater heaven than this plain neutrality which expects nothing of him.

The unending nightmare which had forever been his torment now hovers before him, contained within a bubble. It floats gently between the trees of a sparse wood where he finds himself. He looks upon it with awe, but also confusion and resentment. Here it is, the entire universe with all of its suffering—sealed into a sphere no greater than his armspan. It seems so blatantly insignificant.

Picking himself off the earth, he tries to take in the meaning of what lay before and around him. He has not died. He feels more alive than ever\! Yet, feels like he's come apart from everything that ever was, everything he understands. Beyond that world now, he is separated from all of what has been… *and yet there is more\!*

In the distance he hears water moving, feels winds come from afar. This new world (which contains his own) seems larger than he can comprehend. An overwhelming sense of gratitude and curiosity take hold. Believing himself in some deeper or higher level of existence, he is finally free. Free from his private hell. Free from hurting. Free from pain. No part of him desires to dwell upon the awful place he came from, and so he leaves to wander the gentle forest.

There is something both familiar and peculiar about the wood. Has he been here before? The forest has a curated quality, as if some caretaker has manicured the whole of it.

Each tree is given more than enough room to grow, and the brush is never dense enough to impede his way. There are no root-tangles, pits, or puddles threatening to trip him. Altogether it is easy to move through in a way that most wilds are not. It's as though this forest wants him to explore. As if he were part of its expected ecosystem.

Pleasantly meandering for some time, he notices more bubbles like the one he'd come from. They float idly through the nature, drifting unperturbed. Each one is very different. Unique, even from a distance. Near him drifts one of more vibrant colours that welcome without reproach.

Observing the sphere like an artwork, he sees a swirl of strange entities dancing in the most beautiful shades. These beings know nothing of pain, and they know nothing of form. Unlike him, they are of no body at all. Their liberal movement comes without the burden of choice.

*They are free*.

He marvels at the orb with curiosity and longing. It seems more splendid than what he has known. He stews in jealousy, wishing that he had not known pain so great that it caused him to fall out of reality. Happier and grateful to be free, the boy astray remains scarred. It is a burden he will carry forever—the envy of better starts. There is nothing left but to make the best of things now. A lost boy carries on.

Another bubble he sees more clearly, and approaches. It is less mystifying, more evident, and even more agreeable. To him, it seems a place he'd like to visit. Within the sphere, there is a contented man sitting at a feast unlike any before. Plenty is abound, in both variety and wealth. Quite happily, the joyful man takes great mouthfuls of food and drink while a rotating cast of guests keep him company in conversation. They tell each other incredible stories that delight the mind and spread mirth. They make one another happy.

The wandering boy watches as friends, family, lovers, and idols attend the feasting. He longs to share in their joy. Perhaps he could join them? Could he step into their world and share in the party? He wants to delight them with his presence, and give his own stories. Then he thinks the only story he owns is too sad and pathetic to shoulder on anyone. He feels wretched, like people will only be made worse by his involvement. Everything stays better if he excludes himself. 

This thought was common to the boy, even before his painful nightmares. Suffering is such an inconvenience to lay upon another, so shies himself away like a stoic wounded cat. He spares others from burden, but excludes himself from life. It makes ghosts in the waking world.

*Better to not.*

Eventually, the forest gives way to a simple path. It is well-trod and gives the lost boy the first sense that he is not alone in this strange new place. Solitude cannot be absolute.

All paths lead to someplace, so he reasons the choice once again—something or nothing? He could continue his aimless wandering to nowhere in particular, or follow the line to somewhere specific. Harmless curiosity tips the scale.

The path is straight and long. Long enough for him to grow accustomed to the newness that once exhilarated, and straight enough that his mind spends none of its capacity on navigation or sure footing. In the rhythmic trance of forward motion, his mind begins to drift on grander ideas.

Occasionally he passes more of the picture-bubbles. Each shows a different scene. Their novelties provide curio, but he doesn't linger on them individually for any length. Instead, he contemplates their nature. *What are you, anyway?* He can see how many world-bubbles exist, and that each is unique. He understands that he came from one, and that he had known it as his whole world. He assumes there are more people like him, caught inside. He can only guess why.

While in his own bubble-world, he had wanted it to change, or to stop. He never thought about *escaping* reality. He did not even know it was possible until after it happened. Perhaps if he *had* known it was possible, he would have carried a prisoner's longing. Perhaps he should have.

 He wonders if that's what the bubbles are—some sort of cage? He can fathom himself a criminal, but can't figure for what. It didn't make sense. What good is a jail where the prisoner is ignorant of both their crime and the punishment? There would be no means for correction. 

An animal, then. Wild beasts are the only captives who don't know the reasons for their cage. A new view of himself takes shape. He is a creature loosed from its kennel. Whether pet or livestock, it is no matter now that he has broken out. If there is some master who demands his return, it will be their work to reclaim him.

More splendid worlds pass him by, and suddenly he feels small again. One cannot reconcile the delights they show, while his universe knew nothing but horror. Only a zoo curates such specific habitats, catered to the unique preferences of its menagerie.

Was that what he'd needed then? A world of pain? Is that what a creature like him preferred? He accepts that perhaps he deserved his horrible experience. Perhaps the hurting was a good thing. It led him here.

Ahead, the tight canopy opens to a clearing. The path widens near its end to the vista of something real. No bubble distincts where he is from where it is. He at the end of the path, he stands to take in the sight as fully as he may.

There is an enormous house of white stone with a cobalt shingled roof. It has large windows on the first floor and a balcony with parapet on the second. Cone-capped spires wind on its far side behind a sprawling garden space. Various attachments and extensions append the building with expert masonry and amateur planning. By its enormity, he could rightly call it a mansion (or even castle) but neither word comes to mind. House he calls it, because that's what it is. Innate livingness permeates the grounds, evident by the clutter of its lawn, the laundry hanging on its terrace, and the movement through its curtains.

There are no people outside the house, and he does not know the hour. Fear of intrusion prickles as he worries that this is some secret place he is not meant to find. He imagines some noticing him and running out to attack the awful invader. Immediately he thinks to flee, to return to the woods and idly observe picture-bubbles forevermore. Luckily for all, at that very time, someone did notice him and opened the door to the house with a greeting.

She is young like him, but happy. Her hair is braided and she wears a simple green tunic with a knit wool shawl. In her hands are two clay mugs. Their eyes lock from afar. She approaches assuredly, which disarms his instinct to run. The boy does not move to close the gap between them, save for one single footstep. Still, she arrives and offers him the cup. He takes it, hoping for water, and it is.

She asks for his name.

When he speaks it, his mouth is uncertain and clumsy. It has been quite a long time since he said anything aloud to anyone. Some sound mumbles out that he feels is his name, though it's clear that she doesn't rightly hear.

"Seeker?" she asks, piecing together something between his inaudible syllables and her own assumptions.

Seeker does not have the will of spirit for correction, and silently accepts his name.

"Welcome to Reverie House, Seeker." She smiles wide, gesturing him through the open doorway. Other bright faces look out at him eagerly. As he enters their collective, all the old worries about justifying himself begin to melt away.
