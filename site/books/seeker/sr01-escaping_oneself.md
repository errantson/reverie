Infinite worlds pour from his mind into the space before him as he races through each, and unto the next. Behind him, doggedly pursues an encroaching darkness that he dares not turn to see. Each stride is a strained leap from one self-defined horror to another. His mind desperately conjures fresh realities of unimaginable absurdity from each of his frenetic thoughts. With no choice but to chase the insanity overwhelming him, he lets the ridiculous and nonsensical take control. Embracing lunacy is the only way he can outrun whatever *it* is.

None of the worlds he falls upon are rational. One moment he is sprinting through a literal fog of indecision, clothes growing heavy with the damp of regret. The next, he slides down an avalanche of every face he's ever seen as the sky above shifts between hues he has no name for. Every time he repositions his thinking, another abstract dimension forms and throws him headlong into it.

Any new thought will do to escape the hollow deadness which follows him—no matter how painful or destructive. Nothing but motion matters. Momentum staves oblivion.

As soon as he pauses, it is upon him. He glances over his shoulder to face what he so fears. The blackness which envelopes his vision strikes a primordial terror because it isn't really black. It isn't anything at all—just *nothingness*. Within this depth, he sees an abyss so pure that it pulls at his soul with the promising serenity of cold nullification.

Quiet ends overtake his thought and an intrusive worry appears. Already he accepts that the void will be his death but suddenly he fears it will hurt even more. Terror manifests the next reality, and lands him upon brittle ground that cuts like a jagged razors. Pain narrows his focus and snaps him forward, away from the absence behind. Existence fills with sharp edges and a single point of searing light. In the distance, it beckons. He moves.

Darkness retreats halfway. New experience grows prominence again, until he is bisected between total agony and absolute nothingness. That is all there is left once the novelty and complexity of everything else wears away. Pain or death.

Between the two he rotates in cycles, but the ends are all the same—to exist is to suffer and be glad for it because the alternative is no existence at all. He muses on this for seconds or centuries, then comes to a profound conclusion: 

*This cannot be real.*

What purpose is the choice given to him? Why does he have any agency at all? If he can *choose* between death and pain, then there remains a *reason* for his option, and his being.

His capacity to decide cannot be meaningless. It is the only thing that defines his continued experience, and his life. What engine demands his acceptance of torment? When imagining it as some external force subjecting him in myriad forms, he can conquer them. He can keep going.

When he believes himself the cause, *everything stops.*

All at once he becomes disillusioned with the very nature of being. No thoughts of new worlds come. Freely, his delicate mind slips through the narrow crease between one's self-sovereignty and self-subjection. Letting go of control and desire, he loses fear and becomes free again. Slowly, he falls through the membrane that separates him from himself. The darkness concedes. He fades away from everything.

Green. His eyes open, greeted by a canopy of softly rustling leaves covering an expanse of bright blue sky. Fresh airs revitalize him. A temperate sun warms his skin to comfort. Beneath him, soft soil. Wherever he is now, it is wonderful. It is vibrant and healthy. It is a good place to be. He lays still, sprawled on the earthen bed in a wash of peace. It will take a decision to rise, and for once he feels rid of the need to make any choices at all. There is no greater heaven than this plain neutrality which expects nothing of him.

The unending nightmare which had forever been his torment now sits before him, contained within a bubble. It gently floats between the trees of the sparse wood where he finds himself. He looks upon it with awe, but also confusion and resentment. Here it is, the entire universe with all of its suffering—now contained in a sphere no greater than his arm span. It seems so blatantly insignificant.

Picking himself off the earth, he tries to take in the meaning of what lay before and around him. He has not died. He feels more alive than ever. Yet he feels he's come apart from everything that was. Beyond the world now, he is separated from what has been—and yet there is more\!

In the distance he hears water moving, and feels winds come from afar. This new world—which contains his own—is larger than he can comprehend. An overwhelming sense of gratitude and curiosity take hold. Finding himself in some deeper or higher level of existence, he is finally free of his private hell. No part of him desires to return to, or dwell upon that place, and so he leaves to wander the gentle forest.

There is something both familiar and peculiar about this wood. Has he been here before? The forest has a curated quality, as if some caretaker manicured the whole of it. Each tree is given more than enough room to grow, and the brush is never dense enough to impede his way. With no root-tangles, pits, or puddles threatening to trip him, altogether it is easy to move through in a way that most wilds are not. It's as though this forest wants him to explore its yonders—as if he were part of its expected ecosystem.

Pleasantly meandering for some time, he notices more bubbles like the one he'd come from. They float idly through the nature. Each one is different, even at a distance. They are casual enough in their current. Before him there is one of more vibrant colors that welcome without reproach.

Observing the sphere, he sees a swirl of strange entities dancing in the most beautiful shades. These beings know nothing of pain, and they know nothing of form. Unlike him, they are of no body. Their movement comes without the burden of choice.

*They are free*.

He marvels at the orb with curiosity and longing. It seems more splendid than what he has known. He dwells in jealousy, wishing that he had not known pain so great that it caused him to fall out of reality. Happier and grateful he is to be out, but the boy astray remains lost. It is a burden he will carry forever—the envy of better starts. There is nothing left but to make the best of things now. The lost boy carries on.

Another bubble he sees more clearly, and approaches. It is less mystifying, more evident, and even more agreeable. To him, it seems a place he'd like to visit. Within the sphere, there is a contented man sitting at a feast unlike any before it. Plenty is abound, in both variety and wealth. Quite happily, the joyful man takes great mouthfuls of food and drink while a rotating cast of guests keep him company in conversation. They tell each other incredible stories that delight the mind and spread mirth.

The wandering boy watches as friends, family, lovers, and idols attend the feast. He longs to share in their happiness. Perhaps he could join them—step into their world and join the party. He wishes to delight them with his presence and give his stories. But, then he thinks the only story he has to tell is too sad and pathetic to shoulder unto anyone else. People can only be made worse by his involvement. Everything will stay better if he includes himself never.

This feeling was common to the boy, even before his wretched dreaming. Suffering is such an inconvenience to lay upon another, so instead—like a wounded cat—he shies himself away to spare burden to others. Infectious sorrow excludes such living. It makes ghosts in the waking world.

Now he feels hungry, and carries on his way.

Eventually the even nature of the forest gives way to a simple path. It is well-trod, and gives the lost boy his first sense that in this strange new place, he is not alone. Solitude was long contemplated during his forest walk, but this path stands as proof that his is not absolute.

All paths lead to someplace, so he reasons the choice once again—something or nothing? He could continue his aimless wandering to nowhere in particular, or follow the line to somewhere specific. Harmless curiosity tips the scale.

The path is straight and long. It's long enough for him to grow accustomed to the newness that once exhilarated, and straight enough that his mind spends no capacity on navigation or sure footing. In a rhythmic trance of forward motion, his mind begins to drift on grander ideas.

Occasionally he passes more of the picture-bubbles. Each shows a different scene. Their novelties provide curio, but he doesn't linger on them individually for any length. Instead, he stays wrapt in a methodical contemplation of their nature. He can see how many world-bubbles exist, and knows that each is unique. He understands that he came from one, and it had been his whole world. He assumes that all those others inside theirs feel the same. What that means, he can only guess.

While in his own bubble-world, he wanted it to change, or to stop, but he never thought of escaping reality. He did not even know it was possible until after it happened. Perhaps if he had known it was possible, he would have carried a prisoner's longing. Perhaps he should have. He wonders if that's what the bubbles are—some sort of cage? He can fathom himself a criminal, but can't figure for what. What sense is a jail where the prisoner is ignorant of both their crime and their punishment? There could be no way for correction there. At least, not as ignorant as he was.

An animal, then. Wild beasts are the only captives who don't know the reasons for their cage. A new view of himself takes shape. He is a creature loosed from its kennel. Whether pet or livestock, it is no matter now that he has broken out. If there is some master who demands his return, it will be their work to reclaim him.

More splendid worlds pass him by, and suddenly he feels small again. One cannot reconcile the delights they show, while his universe knew nothing but horror. Only a zoo curates such specific habitats, catered to the unique preferences of its menagerie.

Was that what he'd needed then? A world of pain? Is that what a creature like him prefers? He accepts that he perhaps deserved his horrible experience. Perhaps the hurting was a good thing. It led him here.

Ahead, the tight canopy opens to a wide clearing. The path widens near its end to a vista of something real. There is no bubble to distinct where he is from where it is. Something from the place deepest inside him whispers momentously, and at the end of the road, he stops to take in the sight as fully as he may.

There is an enormous white stone house, with a shingled cobalt roof. It has large windows on the first floor, and a balcony with parapet on the second. Cone-capped spires wind on its far side. Various attachments and extensions append it, seemingly with expert masonry and amateur planning. By its sheer enormity, he could rightly call it a mansion or even castle, but neither word came to his mind. House, he calls it, because that's what it tells him it is. Innate livingness permeates its grounds, evident by the clutter of its lawn, the laundry hanging over its terrace, and the movement through its curtains.

There are no people outside the house, and he does not know the hour. Fear of intrusion prickles as he worries that this is some secret place he is not meant to find. He imagines their noticing him and running out to attack the awful invader. Immediately he thinks to flee. He shall return to the woods and idly observe picture-bubbles forevermore. 

Luckily for all, at that very time, someone noticed him and opened the door to the house with a greeting.

She is young like him, but happy. Her hair is braided, and she wears a simple green tunic with a knit wool shawl. In her hands are two clay mugs. Their eyes lock afar, and she approaches assuredly, which disarms his instinct to run. The boy does not move to close the gap between them, save for one single footstep. Still, she arrives and offers him the cup. He takes it, hoping for water, and it is.

She asks for his name.

Though he speaks it, his mouth is uncertain and clumsy. It has been quite a long time since he said anything aloud to anyone. Some sound mumbles out that he feels is his name, though it's clear that she doesn't rightly hear.

"Seeker?" she asks, piecing something together between his inaudible syllables and her own assumptions.

Seeker does not have the will for correction, and silently accepts his name.

"Welcome to Reverie House, Seeker." She smiles wide, gesturing him through the open doorway where other bright faces look out at him eagerly. As he enters their collective, all the worries about justifying himself begin to melt away.
