Entering the maze, Seeker feels the thrill of challenge. Much about dreams has been explained to him, but he has yet to feel the triumph of application. This is his first opportunity to prove his competence in the art of dreamweaving. He arrives in Bakun's labyrinth completely sure of the phanera's artifice. Seeker is aware of the unreal.

The room where he begins is square, built of smooth sandstone and wholly uninteresting. There is a single torch held by a sconce near a single exit, which leads down a dark hallway. The walls stand at least thrice his height, but stay open to a twinkling expanse of dark night sky.

His first thought is of cleverness—he will climb up the wall somehow and escape the maze from a cheater's vantage. Pulling himself up by the sconce is impossible as it gives way when he leans weight upon it. Nearly landing on the torch as he falls, Seeker tries another way. Pressing his back to one wall his feet against the corner's other, he tries to brace and shimmy up. Using all of his body, some of his mind, and none of his faith he fails once more. *I can't do it.* Seeker doesn't think to dream. Reluctantly surrendering, he takes the torch and proceeds down the mysterious hallway.

Flame lights his way forward. The boy can see just far enough not to fear his next step, but never far enough to feel safe. With every foot he fears that something will appear from the darkness ahead. That hateful thing he saw in portent could be upon him any moment, leaving no time to react or any means to defend himself. The vulnerability of every inch through the darkness is excruciating, and Bakun's labyrinth relies on his distress. 

In mockery of his fear, the maze leads Seeker safe and uneventful to a split in the way. He is made to choose blindly between his left and his right. Along the wall his torch finds no explanation and the dusty floor gives no trace of any forerunners. *I am alone.* He wonders if the dream is bespoke. 

The right hand leads down a corridor, into a massive room split apart by a hole stretching its width. Colder air emanates from the great pit. Looking down it, Seeker finds no bottom. There is enough starlight in the larger room to see a ledge across the gorge, and another corridor to follow beyond. They seem very, very far away. *It's not possible*. The distance is too far to jump. He lacks faith in his body, and has more for pain. Dream or not, he does not want to fall.

Bitterly defeated, he turns back from whence he came. What awaits down the left-hand path is met by a far more indignant Seeker. Eventually he *must* try. Continuing past the fork, he ventures down the only hall he has not yet explored. *Be careful*. He's still afraid of the hateful thing's surprise, even from the known behind.

Another strange room—this one long and rectangular, with large vertical slits on its sides. There are lit torches between each, and bright roaring brazers at both ends. Seeing more gives confidence. He steps through the threshold and massive blades swing down from above, ringing with every hard strike. *One-two-clang*. *One-two-clang*. It is the relentless, rhythmic pattern of death. Indeed, those could hurt him a lot.

Bakun promised Seeker that pain exists in his world—that he would *feel* this dream. In his mind begins a crazy disconnect. He splits apart his fear of hurt and doubt in its truth. The wild-headed man plays the boy like a fiddle. Now they both think that pain is just the body telling the mind what is wrong with reality. *So what if I die?* They are dreamweavers, and this is just a dream. He can deny its very reality and thus deny his body's concern. *Only a dream.*

Seeker develops a strategy. *Perhaps* he can move past the blades fast enough. *Maybe* he can dodge their deadly cut. *Luck* might be on his side. It takes courage to keep focus on the dream, but he remembers giving himself for a turtle. Now he would take less risk for his own sake. *I have to try*.

Counting the seconds between the blades, Seeker deconstructs and rebuilds their pattern. He imagines their make, their machina. Seeker does this for every blade, as best he can—lacking faith in perfection. Only once owning the pattern so well that he could construct them himself, does he feel ready. With perfect, flawless accuracy he can predict the swinging of the swords.

*One-two-clang. One-two-clang. One-two-clang. One-two-clang. One-two-clang. One-two-clang. One-two-clang. One-two-clang. One-two-clang. One-two-clang. One-two-clang. One-two-clang. One-two-clang. One-two-clang. One-two-clang. One-two-clang. One-two-clang. One-two-clang.* Yes. He's sure.

Seeker yet learns there is a greater difference in time.

Steady and full of faith in body and mind, Seeker's fate plays out—a dash past the first blade. *One-two-clang.* Then a stumble and a panic. The second blade, *One-two-slice\!* Was his body too slow? Was his mind not yet ready? Why?\! The sword crashes through cleaving several inches into his chest. His arm dangles, a limp weight at his side. *One-two-slice\!* Down comes the next, straight through Seeker's neck. 

He is trapped in a severed head.

*Why am I still here?\!*

He is trapped in a mutilated body.

*Why am I still here\!?*

He is trapped in the reality of Bakun's labyrinth.

*Why am I still here\!?*

The hateful thing creeps over shadow and Seeker's vision grows dim. His suffering is wretched—much stronger than his means to deny it. Trauma strips him bare, back into the nightmare. He goes. Nothingness is the only escape from these pains of body and mind. *Oblivion.*

*That's not where I want to go\!*

	*Too bad. So sad.*

First he stops blaming himself. Then he stops blaming Bakun. Then he stops blaming his body and mind. All that's left to blame is his choice, but he has a pure faith in his choice. Even in failing, he retains belief that this torment is the means to what he seeks—the art of dreamweaving. There is no other way for him to understand it. Progress toward any freedom always comes with a risk. He accepts this one as his.

He feels himself fall apart to memories, his essence being scattered in the void. One of his many fractures stands strong and remembers Reverie House. It becomes a symbol that guards his spirit, and returns him safely to the realm of dreams—to our wild mindscape.

From the clutches of nothingness, Seeker returns to life on the dream of all dreams. His memories lead through the path of his way, returning through a thread to his place in the cellar with a wild-headed man, at Reverie House.

"How easy was that?" Bakun prods. "How'd it *feel*?"

Seeker can't tell if it's morbid curiosity that drives the wild-headed man or true sadism. "Awful\!" the boy responds.

The dreamweaving lunatic laughs insane, "You were warned\!" Seeker had gotten exactly what he bargained for. "But, what did you learn?" The lesson is in the question.

Seeker didn't learn anything. Did he? His return to life felt more like unlocking something natural from within, rather than a newly gained skill. He returned because of faith in his now most obscure reality. As strange as this life was becoming, it was certainly his own. Understanding this made the wretched agonies go away. "I didn't learn anything?"

"You're doing better than expected\!" Bakun is proud.

The boy looks around the cellar, breaking focus with the man and his maze. There is something unpleasant about those dreamweavers who forever linger in the cellar, making wild-headed dreams as Bakun does. Seeker relates to them a little more now. *This is easy.* He can live a thousand lives from the comfort of a dirty pillow. Why would anyone ever leave?

"You're not done yet." Bakun is waiting.

"How do I avoid the blades?" Seeker redraws trap schematics in his mind. Pains have kept the memory intact. "I was trying to avoid the blades."

"Trying? How?" 

"By moving faster. By knowing." 

"Trying and knowing won't help you find what you are looking for." Bakun strokes his wavy mane. "*It's all yours*." He avails the labyrinth once more. "Whatever you believe."

Seeker swallows. He imagined himself moving faster than the sword, but had never been certain whether he could. *Maybe. Perhaps. Lucky.* These words rang in his mind before he'd taken those fatal steps. Bakun was making it clear that they were the reason for his failure.

"Have you ever had a dream so surreal, so bizarre, that you knew it couldn't be reality?" Seeker prepares to reenter the labyrinth. "When the doubt of it entered, you woke up."

"Yes, I think so." 

"I think the waking world is like that too."

Returning to Bakun's labyrinth, Seeker quests for the power of all dreamweavers. He has escaped death multiple times, and returned to the magical forest between our dreams. He is fearless from within his dreaming castle, as he explores a purely imagined realm of adventure.

*I am forever changed in fiction.* Seeker finds hubris.

He still doesn't know what he's looking for.

Bakun leaves.

The boy is in a maze, with a torch. Evil hides in the shadow, and pain will find him once more. *But I will return.* He reaches the great pit and takes a flying leap. He falls.

For a thousand years he sinks down the hole, always hungry with anticipation for the end. He grows impatient for his own death and elects to invent an escape. At first he tries to change the dream, to give some object to save himself (even a platform to splat upon), but nothing comes. Bakun's world isn't exact, but it's stronger than Seeker's imagination. So, the boy imagines that he was never there to begin with.

"Took you long enough," teases Bakun at his return.

Seeker finds focus hard to maintain between the cellar and the dream, now that believing reality is optional. "Reverie House." It's a permanent stamp on his brain. The deeper impressed, the easier it is for him to find it. Seeker is back in the cellar again. Bakun. Reverie House. "Leaving a dream is much easier than dying," the boy reveals.

"Oh. Yes." Bakun agrees. "Absolutely." He knows.

"I want more." Seeker demands. The wild-headed man provides to his delight. "This dream is fun\!"

*It is a pleasure to dream.* Seeker finds freedom.

He still doesn't know what he's looking for.

Bakun leaves.

Knowing one's limitations can protect against many errors, but the unknowing of one's potential allows for more. Seeker finds himself at the pit's ledge once again, less afraid of mazes and blades and hate, but deeper fit into ignorance. His only concern is his next step, a mastery of manipulation. Seeker will change the very laws of nature.

*I can do anything\!* Seeker believes in himself beyond all rationale and reason. He *is* a dreamweaver, and will conquer this challenge. Yet, he has never jumped so far in his life. Perhaps others could make it—maybe big strong Michael. Though, the boy was not equal to he.

*It doesn't matter\!* Seeker believes in the nothingness of this reality beyond safety and sanity. He leaps his hardest and imagines himself making it, landing freely on the other side. He does not.

Seeker falls again, then returns to the cellar. He has words with a nonsense-talking man, and becomes more like the others down there. Everyone is trying to figure it out.

"What am I looking for?" the boy asks.

"Seeker, I don't know." He returns to dreaming.

*It is my dream.* Seeker finds nothing.

He still doesn't know what he's looking for.

Bakun leaves.

What trial the labyrinth brought is lost. Victory is free. He can leave the maze anytime, but there is greater purpose to seek in that which he self-defines. *What do I want?*

He decides he wants to jump over the pit. He does.

There is a momentary thrill as he understands his capacity to shape this dream-reality. Its pleasure fades immediately. Hollow, like masturbation. *What do I want?*

He decides he will voyage the corridors. He does.

He decides he will find thrills and treasure. He does.

He decides he will feel sorrow and misery. He does.

He decides he will live. He does.

Seeker decides he will change the dream to his design. Bakun becomes irrelevant. Reverie House becomes nothing. Whatever he wants, he can have. He just needs to decide. 

*What do I want? What do I want? What do I want?*

He decides he will see a chamber of many doors. There are now infinite portals before him. Behind each is an endless number of possibilities. It goes on forever and ever.

*When does it end?*

	*Whenever you choose.*

Dreamweaver Seeker then exits Bakun's Labyrinth.

The wild-headed man is not there. Seeker does not care. He feels free. He understands dreamweaving. He is free\!

*Everything is a choice.*

Is this what Bakun sought to show him? The labyrinth remains, as does all of everything. Seeker doesn't care. It's simple to him now.

The boy collapses on the cellar floor, as he gives up on Bakun's phanera. Nobody in the cellar worries about him. As he glances around for signs of life, he finds little. More just like him are wired to dreams of infinity, witless to anything but everything. This is both comforting and embarrassing.

He walks it off, pacing around the dirty cushion ring which now feels like a second birthplace. This is where he was born again, immortal in dreams. A true dreamweaver. This monumental understanding now divides his life into two distinct eras—before and after awareness. Gratitude overwhelms him. Seeker feels a responsibility to better understand what he can do. He makes plans for the library. There, he will master the art of dreamweaving\!

While Bakun's phanera stays inviting, there is no sign of its creator. Seeker meanders through the cellar in waiting. Away from the slack jawed dreamers, he digs lightly through the junk. He comes across a small wooden box, it rattles as he picks it up. A question remains. *How much do I decide?*

Seeker imagines opening the box and finding an egg. Inside the box will be an egg, just like the one Ollie gave. Whether trick or truth, inside the box, Seeker will see an egg.

Inside the box is a red rubber ball. 

He has no power over our wild mindscape. None do.

Time does not pause for Seeker.

Where is Bakun?\! The boy has no idea how long he's been dreaming, but he's truly had enough. Seeker leaves.

Up the cellar stairs he climbs, and things grow noisier with every step. There is a great commotion ahead. Seeker hears shouting and metal atop. There is a panic out there, sounds of a serious crisis.

The boy turns back to the quiet of the cellar and thinks of returning to its solitary fun. It seemed a great deal better than the chaos awaiting him. Memory of others drives him out of the cellar's cave, and into the light of friendship. He wants to find Bakun. He wants to find Joy.

Both doors at the top of the stairwell are already open. As he climbs, he sees a flurry of men and women donning metalwork in the foyer of Reverie House. There is a small group with wooden spears, and a duo with short cudgels. Michael sports a freshly bronze-patched visor.

"Michael\!" Seeker shouts at the knight, but he is busy attending a trio in fancy robes.

He looks for a way through the crowd, but can't find a path over the messy assembly and must stop to recalibrate near the bay window. Next to him, an emaciated man in white pants sits quietly amidst the great commotion. He fixates on the phanera in his palm.

"What's going on?" Seeker asks.

"Callie." The thin man answers, level and flat.

"What's tha—"

Just then Michael interrupts, "I see you found your way through the door. Glad you're here." Then he walks by to manage someone else.

"He'll be wretched for sure," says the thin man.

"Wretched?" Seeker asks.

"They're all over the nightmare. Wretches\!" he spits. "These expeditions are only going to make more of them." He points at Michael, "*He'll* turn wretch for sure."

Seeker doesn't know about wretches, but knows how a nightmare can twist. "Better keep your wits," he says in jest.

"Aye. Better keep our wits." Says the thin man, experienced in the failing of others' dreams.

The boy gets caught in the commotion and curiosity. He nearly joins the war effort. Seeker wants to ask the thin man more, but is afraid to get caught in undue responsibility. He flees in a question, "Do you know where I can find Joy?"

"Yeah. Just over there," the thin man gestures across the foyer, and Seeker catches a glimpse of her for the first time since returning to Reverie House.
