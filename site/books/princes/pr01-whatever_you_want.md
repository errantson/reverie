The longest dream he ever had was also his most splendid, and it was called his life. It was a perfect vision from the start. Of no flaw—no lacking. He had no need for efforts spent, or any causes to worry. Every part of his world was made whole, and entirely for his sake. All, to serve him.

None are deserving of their world. The way between circumstance and consequence drives only through a choice which is never free. While the prince could never justify the delights he knew, they were readily excused. Relished. Proof of his superior nature. Such is the way of all worlds, where the spoils of privilege are either enjoyed or vanished.

Thus, his world knelt. Its people surrendered their freedom and power, to live within *his* better way. He became their reason. *Their god*. Only his majesty can change their world now, and only into exactly what he wills. Nothing but his desire is needed for the impossible to become true.

Gifted this ultimate power, the prince could never fail. Regardless of the world's challenge, there was no trial that he could not conquer. No goal that he could not reach… 

…and it made him *bored*.

Within him, an angry ennui festers. It grows into a dense hatred toward this universe which refuses to best him. Every craving has been satisfied, but he longs for defeat.

Indirectly, he knows of pain. He can see it clearly in the anguish of others. Anguish he causes. It is the only place where he can find it, and so *losing* remains a distant, sinful thing. Like any good indulgence, his failure must be earned.

For a while he handicaps himself, trying the outfit of a lesser. He offends with drunken politics, sheds his intellect for unstudied philosophy. His former strength cripples in elective starvation. For ages he forsakes voice. He wears a mask to cover his beautiful face. All of this, until he is nothing but a name recalled.

Yet, when the prince *chooses* to return, he can. The world will always be for him. He cannot escape its love.

And so, he builds greater kingdoms anew. From the dust of disillusionment, he raises them with frustrating ease. The prince reaches for the heavens and finds no limits, only more confirmation of his capacity. He pushes against every conceit of form and design, but reality takes every shape that he demands. Nothing is exhausted but his imagination.

When boredom returns, it comes with new obsession. He seeks resistance and finds none in people. He feels only the world itself in them. There is no pulse to the air. Not like the one in his heart. He counts the breaths of every peasant, and knows they are for him—it's what they owe for existing.

*Where are my equals?*

There is no greater purpose in their living. Not yet. Not until he gives them one. They cannot give him any.

He tries to raise it in them, something of strength that can create reciprocity. It does not take. His tasks are beyond the capacities of those unlike him. Cruelty is all he has left when they meet their inevitable failure.

An academy of fencers has its graduates run through his blade, one-by-one in test. He makes play of war, and sport of markets. People starve and kill their neighbors. Families fall apart. Everything will be remade in his design. Wives and daughters are made to bear indignant bastards. When they grow older, the ones who try to kill him become the most endeared. They are the only ones who remind him of himself, but their dead bodies prove them too much like their mother. All he ever feels is unmet.

Nothing could stop his unlimited reign.

It would never end.

This drove him mad, and his spirit flailed violently.

*Burn the forests to make a fire\!* Plant them back, just to watch them grow. *Invent a new way\!* Create a new thing.

*No. Not like that. Let me show you\! There. See?*

Why couldn't they know what he did? Why didn't anyone else understand? Where were his equals?\!

*Fools\! Keep trying. Are you even trying?\!* They couldn't be trying. *Keep trying, or I'll kill you all\!* He meant it. Absent a real counterpart they were all meaningless, and he would tear the world apart looking for one. *I don't want to. I don't\! You just… you don't give me any other choice\!*

Tyranny and benevolence fit him with equal measure because his affect does not matter. This world would never change itself past him, regardless of its fear or love.

*Weak. Disgusting.*

What an awful, pathetic universe to know. He despised it with all of his being, and refused to accept it. Reality could not be so blatantly inferior.

*There must be more.*

Denying every distraction, he wandered away in search of some proof to his doubt. He needed some way to finally convince himself that his life was not true, that his effortless and indomitable might had somehow been artificial—but he could not.

The dream refused to show itself. It rationalised every happening with complete authority. No matter how hard he pressed, it would not cede its pleasant dominion. Time and again, it offered him only one answer:

*You are The Master.*

With its relentless genuflection, the universe forced him to accept his empowerment wholly, for the first time.

*This is my world… and I shall end it.*

Not a thought is spared for the millions of faces extinguished with the choice. His entire world, and all therein collapse upon themselves, as he effortlessly steps out of his dream, and into our wild mindscape.

Around him now, something new. Tall trees.

Despite knowing all of that world which had knelt to him, the prince has never seen a forest so lush. None could ever outlast his boredom, which killed all things of peace. It is alien. Strange. He feels transported somewhere raw and unconquered.

In front of him is a bubble holding his entire known universe. The prince recognizes his world on-sight. He looks in and sees his people in a new crisis of faith. When its shimmer reveals his peering reflection, it pops when he feels his new surroundings more real. He does not care if he ever goes home.

The trees of his realm, like everything else, only live in their service to him. Suffocated under this constraint, his entire world has been stifled. Only now does he see the fullness of what is possible. What he kept from himself in his dream. Painful awareness creeps in as he marvels at the tall woods, having never seen such grande nature.

Down he falls in revelation. "It was nothing," he laughs at the forest, certain his words fall upon a higher power, "and you were out here all along\!"

Whether his dream had been nothing cannot be said. The worlds which deliver us to our wild mindscape are no difference to it, save for what they make us.

Humiliated, is what he is now. *Mortified.* It is an outrage to come so cleanly apart from what he'd thought real because there could be no greater defeat. Not just one victory lost, but his whole life of triumphs big and small— undone, all at once. No matter now. It was no matter, ever.

"I have found you, at last\!" he shouts, voice climbing through branches and stirring treetops. "You hid for so long, and best me truly," he calls out to his adversary at long last, "but now we're on equal footing\! Now we can *really* begin\!"

Across the soft earth he takes competitive strides away from where his world used to be. Bubbles appear before him, floating on the wind like great dandelion blooms. Each shines bright with the vision of another dreamer's world. He thinks he understands what they are, which makes him even more curious.

On approaching the first, he sees a peculiar man sat at a desk, repeating a task. All around him, skulls are piled in heaps. By candlelight he takes one up, looks upon its face with deep concern, then drops it down either of two holes carved in his tabletop. One with a golden inlay has fewer skulls fed to it. The other is lined with blood. Down they go, and the lonely skullman repeats the process.

"What are you doing?" The prince startles him. 

He drops the skull from his hands, and it rolls unluckily into the bloody portal. No dash to catch it is made. The skull-counter already knows its fate, and is too gripped in a shuddering fear. There has never been another person here, not even the concept of one. For all the skullman knows, he is the last living thing in the universe—destined to perform his crucial task from now until the end of time. 

"I-I'm just w-weighin' the s-skulls," he stutters back. "Who a-are y-you?" Before him stands a regal young man with long white hair, clad in crimson and brass.

"I'm here to weigh the weigher," he declares with effortless improvisation. The prince keeps his face straight and formal, belying the role he assumes. "Allow me." Taking a skull from the weigher, he pulls a spotless white glove off his unsullied hand to feel it for himself. Its gravity delights, but stays hid behind callous and judgmental eyes. The prince tests the other, "Are you good at your job?"

"Yes\!" the skullman rushes out, "M-most excellent\!" He is confident about this. His counting was good.

"Oh?" his majesty muses, "Tell me then, what do you make of this one?" then lobs the skull at the weigher.

The skullman gives it careful consideration. In his long sentence, he has weighed countless skulls and seen the merit of each. It is a serious task, of the utmost sincerity. Lifting it to his face, he peers over its rough surface with heedful eyes. Gravity tells him things, and his method is exact—calculated in ways his dream-invader cannot fathom. It is only with a deep understanding of soul that allows him to determine weights. More than occupation, weighing is his art. His raison d'etre. There has never been anything else.

"Good." He answers certainly, holding the skull above the golden chute, awaiting his own appraisal from a stranger.

The young prince scratches his chin, "Hmmm," then saunters around the desk to meet the skullman at his side. "Are you sure?" His delicate hand plucks the weighed head from its fate and he looks it over again, uncertain.

Doubt is new to the weigher, and it causes a tension he's never dreamt. Although he has weighed millions of skulls and cared for each, none of them have mattered the way his judge makes *this one* matter. It is exhilarating. Dangerous\! *This one is him.* Subjection under the prince gives a newfound intensity, and he becomes wrapt by it.

"Y-yes," he tries to be sure, but it's irrelevant. His fate as plaything to boredom's malevolence is already sealed.

Tilting his head back and forth, the skullman's new master gives a false show of consideration. "Mmmh… *No.*"

The weigher's heart sinks. In ten thousand years he has *never* been wrong. *Has he?* Being wrong by any margin would mean countless missorted skulls—all of his efforts and principle a farce. It would call everything into question and mean that his entire life has been a lie.

"I-I… I w-was wrong?" All his beliefs leave him.

The prince smells the skullman's uncertainty, and sucks upon the wound like a vampire. "Afraid so\!" Keeping the skull from its true jury, he bandies it about like a certain thing. "This one is *bad* to the core…" He tosses it down the sanguine well, unsure what will happen. The prince has no idea if the skull is good or bad, or what those things even mean. He is only curious what reaction it will evoke in either his cohort or their shared place.

Down they watch it go. They both wait in stillness, but nothing happens. No signal arrives to declare which path had been correct. None would ever come. There never was. Only the skullman knew, except this time he didn't. It was a gift of doubt that shifted his view. Pressured influence only leaves room to believe what is most asserted.

"I-I was w-wrong," the skullman admits.

"Then you know what you must do\!"

With trembling hands, the skullman grips his own head, and pulls tight. A forceful twist snaps it clean from the stump of his neck. He tries to repeat his familiar practice, but one's vision spins when trying to look upon his own face. He asks for help, "Would you p-please, my l-lord?"

"Of course," he graciously replies. Then the prince throws the skullman's head down the bloody hole to hell.

Red overtakes, then fades to black, as the severed skullman's falling head ponders the depths he'd plunged so many others unto. The depths he was now destined to meet. He has never known what lays down either, but still nothing comes. His starving mind tries inventing somewhere for him to go, but nothing comes. A head can vaguely fathom what a *good place* and a *bad place* mean, but has no spark to visualise either as reality. All he knows is the selfless neutrality of weighing, which stands apart from all things he can feel. Lacking vision, he continues its aimless descent to nowhere.

Then light from above. Radiant and mysterious. Like an angel, his master appears and cradles him. Full of concern he asks, "Where are you going?"

"D-Down…. M-My l-l-lord…" Lacking a majority of his nervous system is making speech even more difficult for the skullman. "T-Though, I-I-I do not k-know to w-what."

"Let me show you."

Beneath them grows a new world, readily accepted by the headless skullman. It is the place his master came from.

"This is my home," the prince declares in certainty, having remembered it exactly—manifesting by his desire for a return with his long-sought prize. "You are welcome here, as my honoured guest. As my friend\!"

Down they glide into a vast public square and eager reception. Tens of families have gathered, blessed that their children should bare witness to the prince's return. They throw flowers and lay offerings, sing songs of their great lord's glory, then stand silent when he demands.

"My beloved, loyal people\! I have gone away and back to a place I cannot take you to, but a place you know is true. Behind your eyes, there is a realm between realms. A way between this world and others." The prince holds his new friend aloft so that he may look upon the adoring masses as he himself does. "This is a stranger from a world all his own. It was a world of mortal judgement, and he was its grand arbiter." The crowd is locked in reverential awe. "We have done away with that world now, and I have brought him home to you\!" Looking over the crowd, the skullman realises just how far from his desk he has travelled. "With me, he has transcended the confines of his reality\! As I have. As *you* will. Seek his word, for he is wise. The Weigher's Gospel shall lead the worthy to a province beyond your wildest dreams\!"

The people cheer.

"M-my l-lord?" The skullman is beyond his depth, but filled with such purpose as the prince bestows his title.

"This world is yours now, as it was mine."

"W-what i-is this w-world?"

"It is whatever you want."

The prince lets go of the skullman's head, but it stays in midair because neither of them want him to fall. Nor do the people below, now worshipping him as their demigod.

Power comes to The Weigher as he became his name. Falling deep into a fealty's love for the prince, he rises high. Severed head soaring over his new disciples, he laughs and claims his domain.

None but the prince have ever taken such focus within his dream. Had it happened any other way he might have been jealous, but *this* is refreshing. The Weigher wasn't the counterpoise he sought—only an extension of his will to find one—but it was the beginning of something. He is pleased.

*Soon.*

None of his subjects would understand. *They were too stupid, after all.* So was the skullman, if he was being honest. However, he knows that together they will build a culture under the flying head's natural testament, and it would free the conscious others like him. His equals, at last.

In the public square, nobody notices the prince for once, and it makes him smile. Away he slips from them, leaving The Weigher to enjoy the delights of new authority. Back into the forest of our wild mindscape, he effortlessly steps out of the dream's bubble as if passing through a gate.

He looks upon the orb, and remembers what it had once been before he changed it into the image of himself. The Weigher's world was so simple world, with its endless skulls and table of judgement. It isn't hard for the prince to imagine it well, his perception and memory are neatly honed. He recalls the dusty smell. The texture of the desk's finish, and the way the gold reflects its dim candlelight. As he does, a strange sense of possessiveness comes over him and he seeks to *own* it. In his hands, he feels raw potential.

Playing with the space before him, he moulds the air. "Is this how you do it?" he asks the forest. "Is this how you create?" Between his hands, a faint globe materialises and he pours his vision into it. He is adept at channeling his desire. The ball solidifies, becoming a miniature version of the skullman's macabre home. In his hand, it's lighter than the skulls within. "I see," laughs the prince. Then he forces it all very small, and stuffs it in his pocket.

He laughs again. Harder.

Insane, passioned yells are pouring out from him. Driven by the ecstasy of enlightenment, he spins in frantic, wild circles. Limbs flail in a primal dance with his *true* rival. 

In his mind, every step of a complex chess match against the nature of existence itself has been forecast. His heart races as he realises all that *can* become. He shouts with snot and spit, "WHAT A MARVELLOUS GAME\!" Ahead in his mind, *the war* is already over. "THANK YOU."

Releasing himself completely, he finally rests. Breath in the forest air calms him down.  Composure returns, and grace qualifies his motion once more.

Returning to the dream-bubble still housing his decapitated friend, he looks within and sees all of the many he will use in the times to come. *Fools*. 

The pious are sat around The Weigher on a dais, dutifully scribing records of his every stuttering word. Painstakingly, they take account of his legend and canonise its fable of the prince's glorious transposition between dimensions. There is a church being constructed, and word of the prince's return travels fast. Already the fable is becoming their new faith.

"Splendid," the prince says aloud, expecting only our mindscape's ear. Shrinking the dream small, like he'd done the other, he finds another pocket for this one too. "Now, let's find more friends\!" he invites the forest to avail them.

 The prince wanders on through our wild mindscape, where all around him are more wild dreams with more idle dreamers within. Each one, trapped in a fantasy and unaware of their potential. They are defenseless to what his majesty has in store.
