There are books in the library, as well as a man. He sits at a desk working on things of his own interest while the world around him falls apart. His name is Zowell and he has been at Reverie House for so long that his name warrants an etched plate. "What do you need now?" he asks.

Seeker hasn't a clue. "What can I learn?"

Zowell likes this one. "Anything you ask."

"What is Callie?" He wants to understand the alarm. Before this scholar, the boy is not ashamed of his ignorance. "What is a nightmare?"

Zowell responds with a calming pace, "She is an idle dreamer, out in our wild mindscape. For a long time she has been caught in a nightmare of tremendous proportions." This, Seeker understood immediately. "It has consumed other wild dreams, and those idle dreamers who are eaten by it face torment in her world until they are broken and changed. They will be wretched, and they will dream of nothing but torment until their waking world becomes sordid to match." Librarian Zowell speaks of pain with utter callousness.

"Who are you?" He wants Seeker's name. "Fill this." The librarian gives the boy a form. It is an unjust price for his question. "Seeker. Welcome." Zowell begins taking notes.

"How can I help?" The boy wants to be useful.

"That depends. What can you do?"

"I don't know. Nothing?" Seeker did not feel apt.

"Everyone has their own ideas about what can help." Seeker looks around the library and sees others reading or practicing. They are weaving dreams and transitions that could ease one out of any number of problems. Zowell takes a calculated generalist's approach to his own problem solving. "So far nothing has worked. She seems particularly resistant to all external dreamweaving—a known possibility," he doesn't miss a beat, "As predicted, only a matter of time."

Seeker looks at the phanera of a nearby dreamweaver. He feels a liberating wind turning him westward, and then behind him a thunder of hooves. Seeker runs in fear but then thrill, as he becomes one within a herd of stallions. They're strong and majestic. He is amidst a family of equals. Seeker embraces this form and relishes his power and freedom with each of his great strides. The herd knows no master, but the bond of their unity stays stronger than any whip or carrot. Together, they give and find their freedom.

"These dreams will do nothing for her."

Seeker returns to Zowell's desk, nearly lost in trance once again. "Why not? Why are these dreams woven?"

"For the wretches," Zowell deals sombre. "Those who can escape The Unending Nightmare but cannot escape the horrors that it's brought them." He speaks in succinct terms and Seeker understands better. "Their wretchedness is not their fault, though they can be a significant problem. These dreams will ease them out, should we ever reach recovery."

Zowell reviews and updates his figures. It is unlikely there will ever be recovery. The probabilities of inevitable destruction are always and more steadily approaching 1\. Seeker does not want Reverie House to end, but is too ignorant to share the details of the scholar's worry. He still thinks there is hope, "What *should* I do?"

Good question. Zowell offers, "Research your own methods. Nobody knows what's going to work."

"I want to make dreams." Seeker offers, and is directed to a learner's alcove of fundamental texts.

"You can, but it won't matter." Zowell releases him, "Just remember. All we lose is time and all we suffer is pain." It sounds like good advice for those who expect to fail.

Seeker looks through the books. He selects one called The Forces of Reality, by Maras and it offers definitions for the composites of dreams.

On the ending of nightmares, Maras writes:

*Dreams yearn for our focus. It is their sustenance. Though, ours cannot persist. We are not built for stasis. No matter how complex, dreams are singular visions. Our innate being yearns to find that which lays beyond. We are forever inconsolable in our ceaseless wondering. It is the undoing of all things, and of ourselves. This is why we keep death. Our only true unknown, and thus our ultimate longing. It is the endpoint for all dreams.*

Reading and dreaming can both be practiced. Seeker learns better how to do both as the world gets worse around him. Part of the library is garrisoned as a makeshift triage for those who've been hurt in the escapade. Delroy and Tawny find him, and inform that Pierre got injured pretty badly. Still he studies, not just the one book but many. They leave to attend Pierre, and return to the escapist finoir. Seeker just studies, until he understands the basics. He eats the egg in his pocket and thinks of Pecky the chicken fondly.

In study, he learns that dreaming balances between the forces of entropy and oblivion. He is taught how to define the springs of imagination that gives experience, and the destructive consumption that ends it. The laws of nature that create centeredness and abstraction are availed to him. The very mysteries of the universe are laid at his fingertips, and stay partway to him like sand in a sieve.

One passage defines his outlook:

*With unchecked entropy, the world accelerates to an overwhelming and unmanageable madness. Yet without its capacity to soothe oblivion, the whole world is eaten and the void still hungers for more.*

Callie is this hunger. Seeker knows it well now.

The same abyssal force of his own nightmare.

The same void that stalked him in the labyrinth.

The same emptiness that ate every vision in time.

The same barrier that stopped all of his dreams.

He names it. *Hopeless*. Nothing matters. *Hopeless.*

Eventually the abyss claims everything. He returns from his study and informs Zowell he's right, "In the end, oblivion wins."

"Yes." The librarian offers no consolation. Instead he continues writing notes between volumes at his desk.

Seeker has watched the librarian over his study, and seen him continue his machinations relatively undisturbed. "What are you doing?" The learned boy can think of nothing worthwhile to accomplish in the face of inevitable death.

"Working." Zowell wishes to be left alone.

"On what?" Seeker can clinically deduce the pull of oblivion within himself and begs the question for entropy. He wants to feel something other than hopelessness and clings to the busy librarian. Zowell obliges the agreeable student on the occasion, not completely without a heart.

He shows Seeker a chart. "I have long been skeptical of our capacity to survive." Zowell points to a declining set of figures, then another inclining. "As you can see," he circles a forepart on the timeline, "Reverie House is an anomaly." This did not seem revelatory to Seeker. "There are many factors which will determine its inevitable extinction."

"The end of Reverie House?" Seeker does not want this dream to conclude. "What? What factors?"

"As wild dreams appear through our mindscape, they can find their way to extreme ends of the spectrum. Dreams of intense entropy that spread their madness like a plague, or nightmares of oblivion that consume everything."

"Yes. I understand," he says, having read a few books.

"Statistically, it's inevitable that one will develop or grow within destructive reach of Reverie House. This one in particular is proving its potential." Zowell moves on through a historical view. "Here, I've counted active dreamweavers over time. Here, you can see the counts of wretches, dreams, and nightmares spotted. There is an obvious correlation."

Seeker tries to understand the math but fails.

Zowell is used to it, "There is a balance to be found, that preserves our longevity. It comes from knowing those wild dreams around us, and dispatching dreams to remedy issues." He closes the book. It's beyond the boy. "Dreamweavers help lost dreamers find their way to better dreams because it's what's good for all of our wild mindscape."

"And you dispatch them?"

"I provide advice." He takes no responsibility.

"Why? If it's hopeless?" Seeker doesn't see the point.

"The natural course will resolve itself, and there's no reason to assume that will happen before all of Reverie House is taken into the nightmare." More doom. "Though there are places beyond in our wild mindscape that she will not reach. I make my own plans for such eventualities."

"You'll abandon this place?" Seeker did not know there was anywhere else to go.

"Yes." Zowell does not invite him along. "Though I wish for it to last as long as it may. This is why I keep my records and more." Seeker wasn't satisfied with the grim calculus. "Preservation is a patient work." The boy does not yet understand time so well. "Our interests are all aligned," he includes the whole house, "but we play different roles."

Seeker turns his back to Zowell, lost in the foreboding doom that now plagues him once more. "We don't know what happens." Zowell confesses only high chance.

"What can *I* do to help?" Seeker makes it about himself.

"Probably nothing." Zowell pulls open a notebook and writes. "First figure out how to help yourself."

Seeker still hadn't accomplished what he set out to do. "How do I make a dream?" He asks, but feels no need to hear the answer—Zowell can only offer theory he's already read.

"Creating dreams for someone else is delicate and difficult work," he warns the slow learner. "Go make some dreams for yourself first. It's not that hard." Zowell gestures at the many examples of others doing so quite freely.

Seeker returns to an old tome called PHANERA and reviews the manual one more time. It is an important text for many dreamweavers, who learn the fundamentals of crafting a dream through its pages. Many before him have come to this library and sought this knowledge, as evidenced by its well-worn spine. Its cover is degraded and bears no mark from its author—there is no name for its reader to thank.

The lesson offered is already understood by most dreamweavers. What he learns is primary to those who find their way on similar paths. All it tells him is to follow the desires of his heart, and that he is capable of anything.

Yet the boy cannot name what he wants. His heart does not make clear its demands like his mind does. When shapes come to define these deeper desires, they are superfluous and unnecessary. Already he accepts the course of his soul's command. There are no names to call these deeper things he now wishes for. They are not real.

Deeper he digs, until he sees the true self of two beats. It goes in, then it goes out. In. Out. *In. Out.* Something and nothing. Over again. Something and nothing. As always was. Something and nothing. Again and again. In and out.

He takes upon the world, then expels it once more. This is how his reality changes. This is why he exists. He is here to express the universe unto itself. This is his truest desire—to take and to give, the round of our gift.

Once knowing, he lets the choice: *I will sing.*

The imagination is strange, coming primal before art. There is no sense within it, no structure, no poise. Echoing from the depths of his spirit, the push comes before a sound. It is his will. He exerts, from the base of his being to his body to his mouth. As noise it will burst forth in all directions if he does not contain it with form. Melodies arrive, but they are not enough to make a world. They demand a place, and ears to understand them. He makes them out of people he loves. Its finalism and oblivion beckon. The song will end in his exhale. Its power will die and bring his dream to end. This is where it delineates to an idea, and the song catches in his chest—never to reach his mouth.

*In. Out.*

He tricks his eyes to see those faces—the ones he longs most to hear the song of his heart. The song that taught him how to be free. They become clear in his sight and his vision expands from an idea and into a dream.

Imagination plays their tune. They sing the song back to him. It is the same in and out, but different as they are, or he would have at any other time. Ensemble they make round, each adding their instrument to collective sound. Disparate preachers of the same choir, the reverb makes it real.

Before him floats his dream, no larger than the seed of a plum. He calls it happy goo-ga, and it will never make sense to anyone but him. It is his first dream he's fully responsible for. Inside the people sing the song. In, out. In, out. Returning to the world he keeps, he stays in a while longer.

Seeker cultivates a reverie of deep satisfaction.
