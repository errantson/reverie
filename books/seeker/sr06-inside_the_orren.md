Seeker watches in wonder as the orren slowly spins in the center of the commons. Unlike every other dream-bubble he has seen, both halves of the orren remain an opaque white that he cannot look through. These dreams are kept private, impenetrable, and protected from external influence. Much of the crowd lingers awaiting its result, but none may know how the conflict between Bakun and Karla unfolds until either exits their half.

When it is Bakun who last steps out of the orren, he is far more gracious than before he entered. He sees Karla sitting offside in defeat, cradling the bronze bust. His victory is declared. His latter exit from their dream-duel is proof of his greater conviction, and the righteousness of his cause. Only, he does not feel like gloating. Instead, he simply offers Karla a firm handshake, and she nods in concession. There is no contest to the results. Karla hands Bakun the bronze head with no reservation.

"I'm sorry," she relents sincerely, "I didn't realize how bad things could get just by forgetting our history." Her time in the orren has shown her the long-tail of a future moving before memory. "We should not take from the past." She is humbled by this revelation. Bakun accepts his victory.

"That's why we use the orren," Bakun places the bust back on its shelf. He too has been enlightened by the process though chimes a little smug, "Now we *both* understand the extent of our choices."

Around him, the crowd gathers in congratulations. Bakun's victory is a rare event. The wild-headed man often makes such challenges, but most frequently finds himself provably unconvicted in his own beliefs. History however, and its defense, are among the few things he takes seriously. Always, he'd stay its protector—even at great personal cost.

Yet, the orren has shown him the total of those costs and the heavy price they will extract in time. He knows that without Karla's metal, there are others who will suffer and wretchedness will grow in our wild mindscape. He offers his hands to a mining expedition, "I will help you find new ore." Karla is delighted and surprised at Bakun's uncharacteristic shift toward helpfulness. "We'll get a few others, and make short work of it—together." 

Karla lifts, "Yeah? Alright." She solidifies their camaraderie with a handshake, "Together\!"

The crowd has already begun to dissipate as they commence recruiting. Only Michael is stalwart enough to assure his participation. Seeker rather mutely follows along. Bakun does not know the boy at all, but is grateful for his quiet and amenable spirit.

 The four spend moments in collection, then bound to  Karla's workshop for tools. They follow Bakun's leadership through to the yonders of our wild mindscape, deeper into the forest than many will ever go. With picks and shovels their march brings them to a long-abandoned quarry. It is where most of the metals of Reverie House came, pulled from the earth by predecessors long ago. They are the first to lay tools upon it in many epochs. At Bakun's command, the quartet of novice miners get to work, happily chipping away at stone in search of useful ore.

As they work in the pit, Michael spots something dark lurking on the ridge above. It is human-like but hunched on all-fours, carried on a distended spine and with a bloated chest that gives it a dominating forward stance. All its limbs are twisted, bent in places they ought not be. It makes wild and unnatural movements. The creature bounds away as it's spotted. "Wretch\!" Michael shouts in warning, "Big one\!" 

"They're everywhere now\!" curses Karla as Michael throws down his shovel and draws the massive sword clung to his back. "We need to find their damned nightmare, and end it before the whole forest is overrun with wretches\!"

"Problems for later," Bakun dismisses the greater job for their present one, "Right now, we need to get out of here before it calls more\!" Their wild-headed commander signals for a strategic retreat.

Karla laments her near-empty sack of questionably viable rocks, "This isn't enough for anything\!" Seeker has also collected nothing useful. The stoic craftsman urges against permanent abandon, "We will have to come back."

"Sure. Later." Bakun loses his newfound concern for her capacity to work. It's too much to keep their camaraderie under threat of wretchedness. "Take what we have, and go\!" He tosses his bag at his packmule, Seeker. Bakun does not fear the wretch as much as their disadvantageous position. The wild-headed man drops his tools entirely to move faster. Karla collects them, refusing to lose more metal.

Michael leads point on the escape, with the others following close behind—only he has armour and a weapon. Bakun is starting to see more clearly the risks Karla's stalled arms production has caused. Seeker does his best not to get in the way.

As they crest over the bank of the quarry's sloped entrance, they come face-to-face with the wretch. Its easy to see that it had once been human, which makes it all the more horrifying to witness. There is such great sorrow in its bleak eyes, and terrible pain in its motion. With no recognizable spirit, its mouth hangs agape—unhinged and wailing awful. Its baleful squawks demand to be heard, and it approaches the dreamweavers with desperate steps. The anguished creature seeks to escape its form and it bears a fearsome desire to express its terrible misery.

"Get back\!" Michael draws forward to the beast, and slashes at it with his sword clung in two fists. The wretch stumbles, then screeches at the knight. It has no fear of pain, only fear its distress is never known. Behind him, Bakun opens his hand to reveal a small teal bubble that he focuses on with great intensity. 

"Admit you were wrong\!" Karla shouts about the now distant bronze, but Bakun drowns her out. Things are not yet bad enough to concede his values. She says something again to the same effect, but he grows even more deaf to argument. All of his attention is laid upon a little vision of paradise that he cultivates in his palm.

In his dream, there are swaying trees and white sands. The skyline melts into the sea with perfect gradience, and on the horizon plays a show of leaping dolphins, flocks of exotic birds, and oddly shaped clouds which delight the senses with constant surprise. To his wit, one could find eternal peace in his oasis—or at least enough to quiet the agonies of oblivion currently plaguing the wretch.

Michael takes a defensive stance, but is overpowered and knocked against a tree. Karla stops yelling at Bakun and runs to help the knight. Seeker just stands there like a dolt. The wild-headed man does nothing but focus on his dream. Kind words will not help his friends, nor will attacking the creature head-on. This dream is his weapon, and he must perfect its edge. He gazes into the orb until he can imagine the wretch's joy in that paradise.

Empathy is not hard for the wild-headed man. Bakun remembers the times in his own life when darkness beyond his control turned him into a monster. He forgives the beast and sincerely wishes to ease its pain—as he wishes others could have done for him in more trying times. Apologizing for their similarities, he lets the dream float forward toward his tortured kin.

Seeker stands dumbfounded as a vision of bliss passes by his head. It grows while sailing through the air. The poor creature sidesteps the oncoming projectile but its irregular extremities make it clumsy and unstable. Michael rises from defeat with a lift from Karla and rushes forward to shove the wailing wretch. The knight bashes the unpleasant beast into Bakun's pleasant dream.

Bakun the fearless leader catches up with his dented defender and helpful comrade. Seeker follows, and they all gaze upon the captive wretch, caught wandering the waters of Bakun's lagoon. The horrid thing screeches a little more, but is then confused into calm. Profoundly bewildered, the wretch looks too perplexed to be angry or miserable. It tries to shout at the little fish and the palm trees, but it makes no difference to either.

For a moment the creature looks like it is healing, its body relaxing and face reforming. It tries to embrace the peace being offered but wretched misery corrupts its own sanctuary. Already the dreamweavers can see an oily, opalescent sheen on the water.

Bakun is disappointed in his failing and comes to a doomed disgust. "It's not gonna last," he quips sharply.

Michael agrees, "Then let's go, now."

They hurry back to Reverie House, and feel safe at last once returned to the commons. The bronze statue glints at Bakun as he enters, and it asks him if he's still certain about his prohibition against smelting. The wild-headed dreamer remains certain that despite their hardship, they *absolutely* had done the right thing. When they count their trivially full bags, Bakun's certainty must answer again, "Tomorrow we'll go back and get more. You'll have enough for a new helmet," he tells Michael. Karla doesn't agree.

A frowning Michael dismays, "It will be harder. That wretch will fall out of your phanera too soon, and it will be waiting. It's also likely to attract others."

"I also need time to iron this out," Karla laments, tapping Michael's armor where it had dented upon hitting the tree. "We can do it. We just need to get a bit more help." Bakun does not like asking for help. "With a larger group we can make light work of it, but that will need some planning and organization." The wild-headed dreamer has no will for either. Karla is more excited, "We could start a committee\!"

"Whoa, whoa..." Bakun interrupts, as he realizes how much more work is ahead if they are to fulfill his ideals.

"What's the matter?" asks Karla.

"I'm just…" Another glint off the bust catches his eye, and Bakin thinks about the risks they'd taken to preserve it. He regrets the further costs to Karla's time, and to Michael's wellbeing. Suddenly, he regrets winning his duel in the orren and privately concedes that history was *not* worth preserving if it cost the present. "No." Bakun sighs, then brings the bronze head from the shelf and hands it to Karla, as if it had always been hers. "I was wrong. Just melt her down."

"Are you sure? Do you really believe that's best?" Karla grasps the bronze woman's scalp, but does not pull it from Bakun's hand. She needs to know he won't regret it.

"Yes. I'm certain." As the words leave Bakun's lips, he feels a chilling pull in his spirit, and his eyes shut tight.

Meanwhile, Seeker's eyes are wide with curiosity. He is still standing amid the patient crowd, watching the conjoined spheres of the orren spin in anticipation. Then, just moments after both challengers had entered, Bakun is spat out of his half in utter rejection.

The wild-headed man tumbles across the floor and lands right at Seeker's feet. An annoyed and resigned sigh echoes through the crowd. They ditch the familiar scene. Bakun was full of hot air, once again. Karla's still in her half of the orren and Seeker is left alone, standing with a crumpled loser beneath him. The boy has absolutely no clue what's just happened. "Are you alright?" is the best he can do.

Bakun rolls over and lays flat on the floor. There is a look of resignation across his face. "Oh yeah," he lies badly to mask the disappointment of his own short-sightedness. "How long was I in there?"

"Uh. Twenty seconds? Maybe a minute?" Seeker has no idea if that's good or bad. "I wasn't really counting."

"Damn." Bakun sits up and hangs his head, then rises. "I really thought this meant more to me," he chuckles as he pulls the bronze head off the shelf, "but I guess not."

He sits at a nearby table, grabs a charcoal pencil and a sheet of paper. Upon it he scrawls, while reading it aloud. "Dear Karla, I am sorry. You were right. Melt her down. What we need now is more important than what we had. Love from your best friend of all time, Bakun." The bratty sign-off covers his shame. Then he places the bust atop the letter, returns the pen, and saunters back past Seeker. "Well, see yah\!"

"Wait\!" shouts the boy. He is desperate to pull himself up the cliffside of ignorance, and Seeker grasps at the man like a dangling rope. Bakun stops to hear. "What... was that?" Seeker conveys his total naivete.

"New?"

"New."

"Alright. I'm Bakun."

"Seeker."

"Well, that's the orren. It's a good phanera for settling disputes," he explains too quickly. "Yields good results."

"Phanera is... one of those bubbles?"

"Yeah, I guess? Look... There's a library just across the foyer that can explain all of this. I didn't realize you were *new* new."

"Sorry…"

Then Bakun caught himself, he recognizes the boy. Was it Joy that had shown him around? He never liked her methods of introduction, and thinks to improve what he can. Seeker has such curious eyes, it's abundantly clear just how absolutely clueless he is. "Don't be sorry," Bakun straightens himself. He could say anything to the boy, and he'd believe it. "Ask away\!" says Seeker's new mentor.

"How does it work? The orren." When the boy looks at Bakun, he sees a different person than the jester he'd first witnessed. Not wholly transformed, but certainly improved. Seeker needs to know how someone can change so radically in just a few moments. "What did it show you?"

"That's private\!" Bakun declares in mock austerity. "It's a test. It asks how much you're willing to sacrifice for your way, and it shows you everything it costs. No matter what your conviction, eventually you realize that whatever you wanted isn't worth the world. Then it spits you out."

"What if you never realize it?"

"Then you never leave," Bakun laughs, then gestures to Karla's side. "She's a really convicted gal. She's gonna be in there for a *long* time." Bakun stands next to Seeker and they look at the rotating white orb. "I feel a little bad."

"How long?" asked Seeker.

"I don't know what it'll show her, but I guarantee she's willing to go to some absurd lengths for what she believes in. In hindsight it was foolish of me to issue the challenge." Bakun shrugs, "She's right, after all."

Seeker likes the way Bakun regards his rival after their quarrel's end. In every fight that the boy had ever been in, things always concluded with greater animosity between he and his adversary. Hearing Bakun speak of Karla with such reverence is refreshing. Seeker surmises that the orren has genuinely made the wild-headed man more empathetic. Seeker did not know this was possible after fighting.

"Anyway, I'm going to the cellar. You want to come?" Bakun half-turns and starts walking away, but slow enough so the clueless boy can follow.

"Do you know where I can find Joy?"

"Joy, eh?" He was right about his recall. Joy had given this poor Seeker a whole tour and he still doesn't know what the orren is. *We'll do it my way*. "Let's check the cellar." 

The hapless boy relinquishes to Bakun, "Okay." Then he follows his new friend out of the commons, across the foyer, past the library, and down the open stairwell.

"Why don't you just take it now?" Seeker asks, as they mosey down the dank descent. "If she's going to be in that orren-phanera-bubble thing for so long, couldn't you just hide the statue so she can't find it?"

 Bakun retorts, "Why would I do that?"

"I don't know. Isn't that what you wanted?"

"It *was*." Bakun speaks slower to try and convey more. "Except, the orren shows you the folly of your way. It gives you a second chance, to correct yourself." Bakun grins dumb, "Don't I seem wiser to you now?"

"I have no idea," answers Seeker, and they both laugh as they reached the bottom of the stairs.

The cellar is wider and more populous than Seeker expects it to be. There is a miniature commons at its head, and a great expanse of toppled shelves, cracked barrels, and pried chests in the rear. The term 'cellar' at Reverie House being synonymous with storage or junkyard, pending one's view of the miscellanea discoverable through rummage. Around the space are several musty blankets, dirty pillows, and other comfort-affirming elements that badly need a wash. All of the mess creates a circular perimeter separating the place where people sit idly observing phanera, and the untamed stockpile of trash around them. Altogether it seems comfortable, albeit a little gross. The dirtiness makes Seeker want a bath, though in this company of dingy dreamweavers he feels he'll never be expected to take one.

Bakun seems incredibly familiar in the musk and plops himself on a cushion, then gestures for Seeker to join. The wild-man focuses on the space between them until an apple-sized phanera appears and shines tan light on both their faces. Seeker looks around the room and sees many other pairs and trios doing exactly as he was, so felt at ease.

"It's not the orren?" he asks, half-sure.

"No. This is a better dream," Bakun lets the tan ball grow a little and it swells to the size of Seeker's head. "This is one of my favourite phanera. I made it myself." He beams with pride. Seeker wants to know how to make dreams for himself too. "I offer this to you, as a way to test yourself." The dream inflates and blocks their vision of one another. Seeker must look deeper through it to hear Bakun clearly. "If you're open, it will show you what power you have within and help you unlock it." The premise excites the boy. "Dreamweaving is an art. The library cannot teach it properly. There is no better way to learn your capacities than a trial by fire."

Seeker focuses upon the phanera, and sees a complex maze from above. It is so vast that its interconnected web of halls and rooms expands beyond the breadth of his vision. There is no discernable start or end he can locate. It matched the wild-headed man's complexity. The boy's eyes grow wide with surprise when he sees something shadowy moving within the corners—alive, dark, and powerful. It lurks behind the places he cannot see, and makes him fear entry. The thing radiates anger. It feels like hate.

"How does it work?"

"Like a game\!" Bakun begins, "You know it isn't real, but that doesn't fix the challenge."

"What's the goal?"

"I guess that's part of the test, isn't it?" Bakun shrugs, but the orb has grown so large in size that Seeker does not see his nonchalance and continues taking every word *very* seriously. "It'll hurt if it's supposed to, but the only real danger is forgetting it's just a dream—but that's no trouble."

"Remember, it's a dream," repeats the boy.

"Just remember," says Bakun, "All we lose is time, and all we suffer is pain." Seeker heard that before. Bakun ceases explanation, "Don't worry. You'll get it. It's better to try these things as a blank slate anyway."

Seeker does  not like thinking of himself as a blank slate. To him, it was quite like being worthless because he did not yet see value in malleability. He wants to believe that his canvas is already laden with foundational primer. On his own he found his way back to Reverie House, and already felt comfortable going in and out of dreams thanks to Joy. He'd stayed conscious and aware in Ollie's dream, and seen others conjure phanera out of thin air—though that's all he knows. He pries for understanding, "How did you make this?"

"I believed that it could be so."

The bubble is large enough now that Seeker can see nothing but the labyrinth. He does not know exactly what Bakun meant, and cannot reconcile the matters of creation and faith. All he knows is that it was his belief in Reverie House which had enabled his return to it, and he allows that to be enough for the moment. Seeker believes that if things go awry, he can always find his way back again.

"Alright then\!" Seeker stands to face Bakun's phanera head-on, ready to be a dreamweaver. "Let's try\!"
