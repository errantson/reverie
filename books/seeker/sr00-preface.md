By way of strange dreams, I have found myself an occasional visitor at Reverie House. Though it's now spoken of as fiction (as I must, for you to find this book) I stay completely self-assured of its reality.

Countless others have come before me and told their own stories of our wild mindscape, as more will come after. This is the nature of the dreaming realms—my version of accounts being no more or less true than theirs. What has separated my good fortune in readership (your attention) from that of the many better author-dreamers who've told the same, is best described as luck in relinquishment.

This story is not mine. It belonged to Seeker, and the others who lived it. Then later, it belonged to history itself. My work has only been that of liberator—freeing it from the confines of our wild mindscape, and sharing it with you. It is in this spirit that I keep no claim over it, regardless of what name any publisher ascribes to its front. While I recognize that the words herein came penned by my hands, I am no more able to call myself its owner than one who claims to own the sun or the wind.

Thus, I surrender all rights of its publication to you.

*Call this story yours, for all I care\!* It may as well be.

By this giving of my labors—the hours spent both asleep in dreaming and awake in writing—I empower you to take share in everything it has brought me. If there is fame or wealth to be found within the words ahead, then let them be yours. No longer am I needful of such things. More, I hope you find the truth within, and your own way to the place between dreams. Perhaps it is there where we will meet.

Though, let us make room for the story. Our story. Your story. Ahead in pages comes the tale of Seeker, who by all accounts is a rather minor figure in the long history of Reverie House. Though his place and (more importantly) his time proved of some significance over the course of an era marked by tumult, invention, and change, it is his witness that's served greater purpose in my own understanding, than any acts of heroism or genius. 

It was my research into the events of Seeker's arrival and the conquering of The Unending Nightmare which allowed for my own appreciation in memory—a thing most difficult between dreams—and furthered my understanding of what natures operate our wild mindscape, Reverie House, and the means of dreamers who seek their escape. Thus it's of Seeker's Reverie that we tell first, for without it I could not fathom the rest.

Thank you for your generosity.

*Thank you for your dreams.*
