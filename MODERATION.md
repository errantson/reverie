# Moderation — Reverie House

Reverie House is intentionally open and community-led. At present we do not operate a formal moderation system or rigid censorship structure.

- Openness: The platform is designed to be as open and permissive as possible so long as the community can continue to gather and create.
- Evolvability: If harms, abuse, or systemic problems emerge, Reverie House will adopt more structured practices. Any change to moderation will be deliberate, public, and discussed with the community.
- Temporary posture: "No formal moderation" is a posture, not a promise of permissiveness without consequence — we reserve the right to adapt.

We are actively interested in exploring private, human-centered verification and governance models that:
- Rely on experiential provenance (community-validated interactions and reputational proofs),
- Avoid mandatory biometric or national identity verification,
- Favor human review, slow deliberation, and contextual judgment over automated bans where feasible.

If you'd like to discuss moderation designs or propose community-driven governance, please open an Issue or contact the maintainers.
